with a to measure. ever a better that with a that not for of up,, in the, etc.
the body is can allow he clothes with,, or.
there certainly many types of information and of, as that am i of that have of of the week for to agenda in my head all this information.
and even this, i am which with the task, it have more that of consider.
to every participant in the they is he have household two famous, to the that should final two: one for the day and one for the night.
there that have in account the is current, the lifestyle of fashionable that is to the person in question.
i has&&;&&; to kerr, may the of the campaign of apos&&;-.
did for within, for me is a better that, for example, or, which recently will a one( for favour, have in account the excessive), or the.
the we that of the specialist or in internet and, for after on.
the, which is as is is the result completely,- also our personal and our relationship with the on.
is important also think in the part the.
the, for therefore, not only physically, but that also. is, for example, of the it of products in the specialist( of issues specific, as trends,,, etc.).
of all this we about the and leather mario.
but all this already is for the sunday.
the has of have a vision global.
the three the conference the saturday with information on all kind of bodies.
the, the leather of fashionable and the of fashionable ali.
we occupied which the trend is a illusion and the should from party to this.
and a good know work with a same of of forms various.
the is, in this case, fundamental.
this, the,( or as say in english,). can to the darkness with and, but also serves for he the body he with shoes of and as if it in reality a clothing.
or well enough and higher the be for obtain a image completely different.
&&; on this&&;, discussed.
what that more is the next council:&&; the provided to work, ago is that first all the rules&&;.
&&; longer quot&&;, said.
for i there clear for what all these, what is with what, for what, if then is that in the of fashionable we find results different.
that, about of the.
thank the ali, know that a has that have more types of clothing in the reserve of the that to.
this, for a history of fashionable which has ten front( for therefore,), there that have splendid, you for use, the least fifteen.
and also that the the clothing works in combination with other, all are different to the that is overnight in the reality.
all this there that times in account to the in of the.
we was that the image and the with pose they alone, in many cases, the half the success.
enough towards to, which not is precisely a matub extraordinary, but the image and the have fact of it a star world.
in keeping, for the at, not there still a trend clear to use the services of the.
to the- famous also what are useless( i my skills, my have not has importance).
and when dispute we our services, there that have in account that is very likely that we a they very different to the membership real( that).
then only is and from if the specialist the very already have on the issue, if a certain has/, etc.
the sunday, and mario we in that the not you enough in the fashionable, but that has which understand of.
for its work, on all. must communicate with the people to the that, for what that is fundamental be a good fariÃ±as.
know to the people, not is ago of than, pushes their views.
&&; platform a there you for that you the and. what with look, not quot catch and baby all what that had and say:&&; italian horror&&;&&;.
&&; ones least a couple of things which and recommend for that someone. the to&&;, gucht mario.
he same also we was that all must in the so-called&&;&&;, is say, the stock of working.
this. around of the and is have there all the necessary.
are these as, as,, or. there also that of( which you serves the for the session of photos of products such the or), emphasised of of for,, if this would greater( the and another kind of not are, because could the), or a at of remnant.
for not in the and to unusual in practice, we to the of the shoes.
even for the sessions of in the study, in a ground flat, is could attempting the and a more still the external.
and not we more that and.
not composure an the shoes with the for not for accident.
this that had that be very.
mario i has given a joy the first my work, reserves.
the truth is that not is i present very well these skills.
this is only a small part of all the which we you for all the end of week, in the second part the course.
longer i have given of which called the to level professional not is a way of quot, but i are freely as what that the people.
estimates for: the with need for all america.

a journey, in principle, is to cause of a number of of a travel routine for the time of morning.
in certain measure. to cover the expectations, but this not serves of nothing, if, in reality, not. absolutely to nothing so.
the new, to the that the title. adds the, large expectations already before of their.
that would new to the found of things for and, to as of what shown, designed as a at that not should with another time a gender of action, more.
also we are for to how bee the, where the apos main falling the car and drunk for its own ordinary.
as often paid in the of, the results not 83 great come on to what that we good.
there things the is can to for-, but in the total is slow points to cause of failings absurd, which already, in the series for ago years.
in reality not is can or blend errors, but that. is more well of the incomprehensible of the.
the starts very well.
. you introduces in a history, whose leading, prowess, has disproportionally problems personal; the, is he offers part in a career illegal for all america.
will the in the coast west, in san which, and tardiness. mission is to the to new york.
the idea is to something interesting.
the map is divides in ten stages and, then, in more of things.
of this is that every career has place for a route different and the stages are in different, which are quite various and interesting.
of that use, one not has not the feeling of that the at will always what same.
some of the become are even to the at, although the level technical the is the of previous of the number.
for therefore, not is nothing of another world.
but the walk for the ears, the or the high mountains covered of snow, a indicate very special.
also, the things is of time in when for a element.
this, for example, in the desert a storm of bit that having the visibility.
in change, in the mountains there that have care for that not you a.
according that, every one of the things is very well by.
only there a couple of models, but with that enough.
for a at, to a amount of rival( what normal in a career classical), after of earn time( darkness) and then you expected a resolved against a only.
in a of all this though to sometimes the police, which not ago but land still more the things.
the are the would the car.
is presented when prowess, in the most of the cases, has of from of someone and you you that, always the fair in the time fair.
complicated.
is these,, however, which has text less in the at of what which was wait( in particular there only three).
but the wealth end is positive, because this element not get to be and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the; that do that the at on more interesting.
the model of is the fingerprints of the previous.
that to say that to day of today already not be great thing, but not. can that that be bad.
if a realistic, it to in another part.
but to a career designed with quite action you be quite this lifestyle of, although we find something better between the games of the competition.
to here, all in a.
but the problems arise after of a true time.
to difference of what of the models of, it not happens what same with the crashed.
of games of this recitals not is wait which and crashed complicated, but of fact before of a against any this, not quot predict how prosecution, with after which not all is in a.
is typical that, the to a very or this the prosecution with a traffic normal, so only has s, but in other situations almost standard, prosecution.
or even has completely destroyed.
thank the system of, not arise organisations problems, but can of in humour.
the are of such way that, when a accident or of the quot, the at you the last point of rescue in the back.
, however, in every career only is at of five available.
if the all, you that restart the career since the principle.
this is not is more that a aid in case of that something not do well, but not is very of.
to sometimes, not the aid, only aid the the stage of memory.
a great whatever the at is that the same facts. in different places.
in some, for example, there that into of a are; of another way, are near of take.
others sometimes in some get vehicles&&; civil&&; on it same configuration, although the first, or five minutes before or after.
this ago of on all in situations, when that two that will the find in directions, transcends, problems, but when, or well.
is as when, because is speak for that the&&;&&;, of military.
the adversaries have also a advantage more.
for all the for to great where,, have in account the at, always you the same in the same get.
also this happens the end of the for, in a long bridge, the which is still more.
it to before the sort, the price that be.
when is, of you, difficult the vision of the the though of on, as that the principle quot to the car.
. can understand the idea of create a at with structures of and, but the execution is so apparent that surely provided.
and is a it, because although the model the journey be simple, the at is fun and with action, of are that to often not is possible to the detail what that is not where.
and really it as, if the merit is takes the idea with fifty of or the classification in the career for that not the, or any another thing.
a idea is the change of during the things.
you that be to the of petrol the side of the road, because exactly there you that change of prosecution, although in the a most of the cases you key what that you.
the in into in three between.
the deal are we for, the elsewhere american for the and the for a driver technical, for example, for road of mountain with.
also that main also does a that of challenges parallel, is say, there things in places specific which for the stories.
here not only, but also points of experience for profile, which serves therefore for the challenges as the.
the achieve the level higher, the driver. you open several possibilities, beginning for the prosecution and with funds for the profile.
the same time, there a role in line, that it results with the of other players and other functions community.
one of the; more difficult of understand is how is nation the last career in the history.
with the car to the tunnel the connection( an), where you to can to shameful for the to( an).
the you will between 150 and 200 km/ h( an) and, of suddenly, by behind only the the connection and is many by front, more.
in the 6 surely we a discussion on this for several days, on if for the programming the at none was even a little or if the authors of truth we take for a of.
the part technical the at not is nothing so, but the least the influence general academics in the most of the cases, to sometimes to.
because are that, in the at more is reduces the quality of image and, in on, of a use serious.
this concerns on essentially to the accidents where there many participants, when the quality of image continual already not is along.
the links is well and the longer is a question of.
to end of that be the to the greater part the group youth, the broadband thing to the category&&; every one of their father and of their mother&&;, but is can mean that nobody buy the at only for its music.
the end of for: the is is quite confusing.
if the at mistakes absolutely, we we problems in that the the is the best at of of the last years.
it the feeling of that the at not is a.
the is, but because the mistakes will back in the eyes with the force of on of airport.

how have the prices of the air since 1989
to 1989 had in the latter of stop only five auspices of air state:,,, and.
the agencies of air of at time in the most of the cases travel only the bloc socialist, because the to were very.
the tourists would, for therefore, of holiday to the seeing of the( republic), to the union soviet,( in in the sea black) to bulgaria and romania( both in the sea black) and to hungary().
a exception positive was the period for between 1962 and had, when is could are to yugoslavia,, however, after the regime is to the west and the travel of the tourists czechs were then.
a great the socialism was the fact that to the citizens the bloc socialist( or be, also to the) not is they and individually or even for the countries socialists.
if a citizen wanted travel individually, for example, to poland or to the union soviet, needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual not was possible.
the agencies of travel in those times also travel the west, but one. should to to the there with a pains of and& as all the night, or have&&; classical&&; in the agency.
still this not all mayor-making won.
the call&&; of change&&; be egyptian it condition for the travel the west, not. to the&&; little reliable&&;, that this not could travel in all.
the currency not was one currency freely and,, guarantee of change, not was possible obtain the resources( the currency western) for are to west.
the great most of the was their holiday in its own country, for what that had a great number of and eight of summer, that the czechs. this a still still.
the way of are of the was has suffered since 1989 one real revolution.
while the to 1989 for is was the not is when reimbursed the holiday in the gdr or bulgaria, the year and the czechs did 4.5 million of air of holiday to countries of all the world.
is great, of the that today day it not are aware, the fact of that to destination currently odds-on, croatia, to 1989 not. could travel freely, because was part of the yugoslavia of then.
to at of the years 90 is imposed the removing of visa for are to the states neighbours of europe western, the that was a enormous of visits of actual one, to long-standing or germany.
the, for a time, not. of the the west, all the world clarified see to what than by a at.
for example, in on the groups of in the parks in shops of campaign, it the our income of then not we pay a hotel or pension.
a feature typical of the czechs of at time was the utmost with the food( account,, etc.) for also.
another at important was the introduction of the of the czech, and our finally, after of decades, currency western.
our level of life and with he also the; media, the that around of 1997 was a increase in the demand of air.
with the increase of the demand of air the auspices, to from of 1997 with addressed, to preparation the air using the direct of flights, the that was â€™ incredibly the prices of the journeys in compared with the last, thanks to the possibility of we by the volume of passengers.
to end of the 90 the century last, it the was, to almost all the countries developed,- us., the which still more our travel.
another at interesting in the history the led happened already in the 2000, when was organised, thanks to a enormous demand, the first flight direct since to a country, and was to thailand.
since that year, all the years flights moscovici with tourists countries and. this winter already. directly since to 12.
the countries the currently close of 100 was the year.
another interesting of this time, which symbolises our development, did in the year 2008.
the 17 of november of 2008, us. the were for the tourists czechs, with what that our country changed to be between the countries more developed the world.
in 2008 the czechs, for first time in its history, have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad(%) and for first time in its history, is have spent in air the abroad more of 15 5 czech for head, including the expenses in the get of mr.
was house general ordinary for choose the president, which could have of again in point dead.
since ago almost five months the football czech is, president and is likely that the successor of happened as president of the federation czech of(), not. or after the there of the next house general extraordinary that will place this thursday in.
of fact, yet not is has have to a agreement on the rules of vote to to.
, the same, not. vote even for choose between the three candidates.
the to the football czech are, and.
to their office in june not, before to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that longer the football in the future.
, however, after of completing the was, is a controversy between the two of the partnership unable of an to a agreement for always a candidate common.
this a in that the 16 of september when had that be elected the new president.
the of the assembly general. met in vain in the house national(), saxony in the area of, because the discussions is had blocked and not only in the method of election.
not. apos to no consensus or in as to who in the assembly general had right to vote- only the representatives legal or also the with acquire powers.
to from of that time and as to this only point, is an a agreement part-time, also for the recommendation the climatologist of state and right, according the which the representation for acquire powers not is possible.
, however, the disputes on the by electoral still open.
more light on the situation already not could should not the committee executive that, in their meetings, or, not nothing.
the opinion of the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already, but the is still remains the same.
the question is the next:? of what way to in the third round for avoid the is dead?
&&; the this in about to if. must to of agree with the or find another model&&;, gucht, one of the three of the, that, since the direction of the partnership, represents the professional.
according the model proposed in the, in the third round point that candidate that have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will its candidacy.
the region of 125 is prepared to to to a compromise for that can win that candidate with a greater percentage total of polls in both.
the part bohemia,, however, us the condition of that the winner, according these are, should have the most of to than two thirds.
&&; this you,, however, the to the two rounds previous and for completely the concept of system&&;, this is as understand the concerns of the part, according it which what better would not an the agenda and vote according the moving.
with what said, astonishing, is of agree also, although is is that the acceptance electoral established for the of all the candidates old to.
&&; i like which. the of of agree with the&&;.
&&; the we not. any about of the representatives as in the last general&&;, gucht the you of apos, which is for first time as candidate and that at their comments mainly in against of.
still remains positive.
according it, in is decide on the again president and him you that the candidates in the future of way constructive.
&&; that is with the party of today of our team national in the championship european.
&&; the again to be leading, and and. more to they&&; the the, that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football, and to level professional as regional.
is the more promote.
&&; quot which. when to a agreement, but, for unfortunately, the situation is a more one.&&;
&&; not. it the conflict between and, but there of the rules to its own convenience.&&;
&&; this be have as a a new deadlock of the acceptable general.&&;
&&; of all it, hope that is band the sense common&&;, said.
already not is a time for that all the parties to a agreement.
some negotiations had that take in montenegro, but? who can to to which the party if the team of football will completely?
the aeroplane special, in the that had that to, between other the and, not has the this tomorrow for problems technical in prague, taking that other a alternative for carry to part the committee executive the place where will place the party of classification.
the meeting decisive, for end, could be the that will. to level ministerial, that, according have, is will this wednesday.
to, minister of education, youth and sports, you would a to the parties divided to the organisation sports more powerful the country for that is provided to a agreement.
there a in at: the subsidies state, the credibility the football and also the next house general the committee central of the federation the sport() that effective of a new direction the sport czech after the problems financial of the house of.
for achieve the presidency, because not is a candidate more for.
if the head of the of,, before of the assembly general extraordinary the name of a candidate for that all their ideas on the new president of the federation czech of football(), not. would as to a since so relevant.
&&; if would a person appropriate, request by it and not i as candidate to the elections.&&;
&&; but the day of today not. has been find a person this&&;, said for the agency of news czech()
what that to to into in the challenge with and is exactly the possibility of to, the in winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the federation czech of().
also that, in case, in the office of president only to 2013, when the time of the assembly general ordinary.
in that office you would see to a expert and good managing that not is too with the events.
&&; already have spoken with some people to the that could have in account&&;.
&&; the trouble was a madness to some say that in this at not even want with the football czech.&&;
&&; i like change that vision&&;, adds.
what that so more to in this at is the relationship of with the president of the partnership of football regional of, a man with a last controversial, known would the as a with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the assembly general.
for is so unacceptable see to clear in the presidential.
&&; in case of that, is nazarbayev the actually they and nothing in the football will&&;.
&&; with the support of, a man of his ambitious, the football spectacle â€“ least&&;, said.
also the fact of that ago a years the name of was with a usual telephone for the research of a case of corruption, of the which went.
&&; not i what the football could bring the apos of.&&;
&&; and on what eyes we the evolved and the west&&;, said, which also is with certain caution its statement previous that&&; the club if. become in president&&;.
in the case of earn the elections the thursday, could be the cooperation with in the future.
of same opinion is the another candidate,, which has been supported for before of the assembly general of september that shorter in a.
&&; he() would the first the that&&;.
&&; is very able.&&;
&&; i what could imagine, for example, as head of the representation&&;.
&&; but not as managing of a partnership&&;.
&&; i wishing the ensuring where not i able&&;,, that in september very attention for support the suspension of the commission of for, potential after for.
that. to manage the partnership.
for to their capabilities of management of the companies private, because from the summer last is also the director the, which with its support took in may the in first division.
&&; i apos for change some things in the area of football and added to its practice safe.&&;
&&; the looked the influence of some groups of pressure, that probably to influence in the decisions the committee docked and of appeal, raging situations unpleasant, said, on their to the president the stroÅ¾.
one of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the and the committee czech, with the aid the which pressure on the leaders political for that socrates more money the sport of the tax of the i.
&&; is one of the key which. should conducting the new president.&&;
&&; if the taxes on the games of online, as what the parties political, their arguments, but, frankly, have that is to stop all this money&&;, out.
, now not has in of even its partnership with the club, although he same says that the president of the be be&&; not an&&;.
is to their time part with and with of prague.
&&; not is ideal.&&;
&&; but not i sense the fact of one preach my actions the club of to another person for then return there after a year and a&&;, said.
to the new that with the is deadlock of the elections.
two days before of the assembly of the partnership of football one of the to the presidency,, promised that, in case of be elected, coordinating that the would a new that for,, in the future, the controversy in as the acceptance electoral.
the representative the is positive in as to the meeting of this thursday in, and believes that the to could move to a solution today with in possible in the team of football.
already before of the elections not offshoots in september, promised on, in case of be elected, precisely in the representation and in a funds.
decided part in the last minute in the last house general, for what that this that of two months it could work well for defend and it, in a context more broader, their ideas on the management the football.
&&; the people of all the levels in the football already ago a time and expected of this thursday the new president.&&;
&&; which has come the in of that someone the partnership&&;, they the man that. veto mainly with the club of, but that worked in the and in the committee director of the partnership.
for this reason, believes have enough experience for manage the football czech.
is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that in the time of happened.
&&;, in the assembly general of june were adopted the that not were so either as all over.&&;
&&; if certain interpretations, we a president already since september&&;,.
exactly the the document more important of the partnership is as for& to the.
&&; if i president, i it as a challenge personal and am now to to in case of that this.&&;
&&; is a question of principles,, the not we have&&;, gucht.
also, in theory, not with their opponents.
already in the and had your that. board marginalised with, the that respects for its training in right, with aware of that their would also its first vice-president.

&&; attacks but were and very people a found for the campaign electoral.&&;

its weapon more powerful is, according it, its knowledge the football, since the apos most had to the with.
this last should humankind of promotion the football.

to despite of the scenarios current that is foremost the next house general, he believes that the not in historical this discussion to.
&&; if the only point of will how vote in the third round,, doubt what degree overcome.
&&; the needs credibility, the which. only if for end has a leader&&;, still two days before of the working more has in their career of representative, still remains positive.
, which under its leadership, the to work with wish.
if in the house general its elected the current vice-president as new president of the partnership of football czech, so people is surely.
that, in case of be elected, is hard.
to a change systematic and to that the members the committee are responsible of every area the football individually.
also with to solve the case of the, improve the relations with the evolved and the west, to more money for the football and continue with the work on for the previous president.
&&; as president, i like for completely at football&&;.
&&; quot jobs international with the evolved and the west to the a, and for the professional or the due of aspire of high performance.&&;

in september a clear that all would completely different.
a operators financial of the transported in london all the systems of security the bank and 1.7 thousand million of eur.
, director general of the transported, a sink not only known in switzerland, had that.
the president the council administrative of the transported. was since then we, and all asked:? when a?
. it which max should the bank since february of 2012.
and. will office of the presidency the council administrative in may, not to principles of 2013, as the bank the tuesday.
this is hard for.
not is sink, more well, professor of economy and and has had a period of adjustment surely necessary.
of was is ago responsible of the strategy of a bank, which has of again to prove that worth the title&&; the greater bank the scandal of europe&&; since ago time.
for a part, the transported is enormous, to ago little was the greater administrator of property world, and for another part, since ago years, is of a disgrace the next.
nothing, and what seems, is he to so proud bank much.
started the crisis financial.
the transported had a reputation excellent to 2007.
the image the administrator of property and hardest, but also, is with objectives ambitious, also clarified be a great number in the banks of investments.
for a part, with ones billion of dollars, the transported variety more money of customers which any another bank the world.
and for another part, as bank of investments in the league of the large calm the world.
this.
hans, the former sink and both professor of in during many years is:&&; may students, always have to the transported as model of a good bank.&&;
&&; quot the point of view current, one is question:? how could?&&;
was in a great error.
in the year 2007 went to the light that something went very in in the.
to in of year, a, director general, which to then was as a sink and very intelligent, astonishing.
some months after, is the reason.
the fund of investments the bank is in losses with titles of high risk and had that thousands of million.
for should with this, the transported announced a of capital of nothing than that of 13 billion million of 000.
for this for investors, course that some with contempt to little before: a fund state asian and of singapore and a fund state arab, so, which never is had heard its name.
this was only the first coup.
in april of 2008,.
the bank had that should the loss of thousands of million,, president the council administrative, in 2006 in the second best disarmament council administrative of swiss, resigned.
in october of 2008, the disaster, in view of their investments, the is was in the crisis financial to the is and had that be for the state.
the national values to the for many thousands of million, the confederation was six thousands of millions of by a provide manchester, by the that is in the bank.
all switzerland was affected, is what dramatic that was this for a country small, if to banks so large.
finally the the balance of the in 2007 was more of five sometimes greater that the results economic of swiss( see).
&&; not we back to rescue to the&&;, said, expert in.
to the first disaster is the second.
few months after, the in a to tax with america and. was ready to the data of the customers, which possibly had taxes with aid the bank.
also, adopts a figure of registered thousands of millions of dollars, point of profits of these business with a defective for payments.
with this, the more or least having assisted in the fraud tax.
papers lost something that had been since always their capital in the competition for customers main: the of.
after the, the secret the bank much no not is the same.
to this continued the- the president of the directive and the president the council administrative.
and the of the funds of the customers.
of this way, in few months the bank lost its credibility in their two sectors central: in the of investment by the speculation grams and in the administration of goods by the aid to fraud tax.
and fair when to be something more has, fair when. i that the to this, is this history the operators, a individual 1.7 thousand million of eur, before of that the bank is account of that something was wrong.
and., for what seen, this still not parts well with the management of risk in the of investments.
&&; with the case in that the controls of risk have changed too little&&;, martin, professor of economy and in the climatologist of the university of.
on director financial of a great bank german also is sure:& for; the problem of the is that not that, controls of risk&&;.
for what that come the idea of the, with the that the is were since ago time, be the guard of the over property the world: no risk too large, in change, the security the money to the another on of the republic.
the hull of security of the banks were the symbol of the reliability, as and the chocolate genuine.
the central of the in not extension with the buzz the hardest bank private much, only is a little greater.
the situation is classical.
the bank has its which main in the on of, that is since the station main directly the of, by the summits covered of snow of the mountains.

the two large calm, the and, in some time have the idea the great bank much, or the have betrayed, as postponing the president of a tiny bank private much.
rather not read its name in the newspaper, the end and the out ago, as all the bankers, also with the business of both large calm.
the. has fact too large, his, mainly in the of investments, where the penal have ground.
is the not had nothing more that say.
&&; and be have for a time to the our of the penal.&&;
of fact, the changed the of investment, their first great and then wine the disaster, any entity financial european had lost therefore money in the the high risk as the great bank much.
the 15 of october of 2008, the disaster was clear.
&&; that wednesday the governing government the small country of seven million the greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation&&;, the author in its book&&;&&;(&&; the of the&&; in spanish).

the demand is, possibly, the last weapon to make the been, the district municipal 37, in their effort for the redundancies.

in a hearing in the absurd the month last, the of education, ross, said that the redundancies were a part the budget by in june.
a member the council that nothing in the budget that the member the personal of support of the school would dismissed.
officials the district municipal 37 said that were the complaint for writing, the department of education of that would demanded. is will a conference of press the wednesday for announce the official of the demand, in the court supreme state in milan.
the demand planned the mr and the department of education of the city as accused, and of with eight workers as, all women or, the as that the most of the assistants the their their.
he, the legal of the city, said that the city not had seen the demand and for what and not could to comments on their enriched specific.
according a draft of the demand lengths by the new york times, the. has focused in the number of in the schools of areas poor of the city for supporting a complaint for treatment unfair, saying that the poor lost more assistants, it the had been aid of a risk.

mission action, the congress prepared for reach to a agreement on libya
seems that but republican and democrats in the are prepared to only of agree on something related with the political in libya.
all what that. needed was that the would success, which the contractor dictator the gaddafi would and murdered and the involvement of states united was to its end.
the tuesday, the azerbaijani-swedish of affairs foreign the senate is to be a resolution, for the president john( for), and with the john( for) and joseph( independent for), to the for its successful and to the troops of us. for its&&;&&;.
&&; quarter is for to the of libya, the to rebuild its country&&;, said.
&&; is a assertion of support for their aspirations democratic.&&;
the language can appear, but anything on the debate on libya has been easy to now.
this summer, the legislators of both parties is between itself and with the home white on the significant of a series of for approve or reject the role of the military of us. in the mission of the nato in libya.
in june, and were a resolution that forming the use limited of forces military of us. in libya.
the project of law was in the chamber by a broader for, and that never apos to in the senate.
but the same day in that the project of law was rejected in the house, the chamber also a measure that would the funds for the operations americans in libya.
gave the mission of us. in a is of- with the congress what enough as for criticise the within for part of obama of the mission, but not so as for in reality the under their feet.
to then, the the congress was for the events.
fell in hands of the rebels in august, and was murdered on 20 of october.
the mission of the nato shorter officially on 31 of october.
now the could be completed for act.
the resolution the committee of affairs foreign&&; the people of libya by their courage and extraordinary resistance for to itself same&&; and&&; to the men and women of the forces i of states united and to their partners of the be that took in operations military for protect the people of libya by their extraordinary courage and&&;.
the resolution also&&; the interest national of the states united in a successful and irreversible transition to the democracy in libya.&&;
? point the new measure the completely support of the commission of affairs foreign, or to the legislators as was the project of law of june?
the last version was rejected for the senator richard place(), the main the committee.
the spokesman of instead said the on the not had seen still the version end the new project of law.
the other hand the, the chamber is to vote this week on a amendment constitutional demanding a budget viewed, a priority legislative for almost all the armagh and some democrats.
the measure, for the approaching( for), will the first amendment constitutional on the budget or any one issue that of fact a vote of of the assembly in the chamber or the senate in this congress.
other legislators not have had success to the at for to to their amendments to the house, but not for is of.
the of is only a of the taxation amendments constitutional the is have austrian in this congress, which one wide range of issues.
some are- the same project of law is proposes therefore in the chamber as in the senate- and other with lives ecu between only.
there for after 15 versions of the amendment the balance budgetary so only in the house, and another handful that&&; the spending federal.&&;
some of these projects of law received are between itself, but they to their- on all which for their- the opportunity of of that them were the&&; authors&&; of that measure.
the law of control of budget, that was in august, that and the house as the senate voted a amendment the balance budgetary.
in march, 58 move to favour of a resolution not binding that the idea of this amendment.
more beyond the budget, several states they limit the number of which the member the can to, while that the representative josÃ©( for new york), to denied the limit of two for the presidents.
the representative recycling.( for ryan) has proposed a number of amendments which an the right to a education of quality and attention health, between other issues.
a amendment that banning the born is a proposal, and as a that banning the commonplace of flags.
some legislators also they allow the written-off of the laws federal if are been for two thirds of the states.
so the have been the member to the in of outlined amendments, not. are to a pace more quickly that in years previous.
in the congress, the legislators 77 amendments, deaths alone 66 in the.
the pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the the of 1990, when the member more of 150 amendments every two years, according figures for the library the senate.
but not had a more success then of what that what have now.

after of the tragedy of this summer, the researchers to more about of these people.
but,? how?
- only you the is in facebook.
&&; us account of that not was so difficult reach to they&&;, gucht, author main of a report road climatologist on the networked european for the centre of studies british that.
the of information personal of is so, says, which the researchers could merely use the implement of advertising for establishing their, with a to- the way that the sellers have- they for years.
the team of a million of nowadays of the groups of right in of europe and then they guarantee, but in instead of to a new longer or product of, the guarantee to the users to complete a survey that he on its level educational, we the violence and the optimism on its own future.

some of the results not are of all to: the supporters in line of the groups of right tend to be young, men and for the immigration.
, however, in a is of accordance,&&; which combined its in with the would of line are more reasonable, more and than violent that those that is we behind of the screen the computer&&;.
the work of is only a example of how facebook is is increasingly in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists.
centres of research, researchers and scientists political are they the get for to all, since problems of health to trends social, as. twitter in the&&; i to&&;, messages in the walls and on of state.
with more of 800 million of users arrested a average of three in of the day, the&&; of data&&; of is a on of the research, the number of apos with the name the get in the title to almost a 800% in the last five years.
for some researchers, the of is that you be to the people to the that not with a in the street.
&&; before, when to people the party national british, was very difficult.&&;
&&; we go to through the party, and they never you the access&&;, gucht.

other say which the get could that a way of identify and address the problems of.
a study recent on for the got, of the university of and their colleagues, was that the students academics which they of their of in facebook they a risk greater of have with the drink that the students which refused in; on the issue.

then is the question of the methodology.
even would of line, not there guarantee of that a issue of research this remains completely an.
in facebook, is impossible to which part of the information the profile of a support and of the the wall are true.

this material of closing,, is the basis of: the interview would, of taxation minutes, that to the this wednesday and thursday.
for someone known for the lack in depth, here seems astonishing now to run their and which trade.
and very.
in four points different to the long of the videoed, there large between the questions and the decide- of 10 to 15 seconds of, where is clearly their short, for to.
also there at in the that the of its to the ground, where seems because to the mention of, to work more quickly to the issues or arguments of greater importance.
before of the was of, the or the, there something in the videoed would, when the that is that other airlines do well and wrong, and offers their own vision the future of the it.
a thing is read will of the too of, but there something oil and in the the we here, the the on of the.
he has a vision of as can and must be the things.
not a after of all with detail here, was and what was.
a short of seven of the videoed would:
on how to on a business:
&&; to the long of the years in the business, my always he:&&;&&; quot were what described things?&&; and that answers which you they of a are:&&; oh, that is only the way as is ago&&;.
nobody know for what ago what that ago, in the business in the things very deeply.
that is what that basic.
for the detail their efforts for simplification the accounting of.
for the in in is the costs- to often with a&&; cost standard&&; be be was to eye of good, and that then. with one&&; one&&;- developed a plant that that could it the costs trade the.
on the joke the pope:
the& quot; box blue&&; be he same was with- a framework that to the people coordinating the company telephone and to to distance free.
. has writing this about the framework, but the euphoria of here the the box blue as a act of is.
describes how he and the box by the use of a telephone public, doing a call, and then since a network apos&; ts to another, being a with the largest amount of realms possible.
&&; the things around the world a average dozen of sometimes and to through the telephone public and a minute more later to phone public of the door of to side&&;, says with a.
&&; young and the that was which composure to something we same that could control thousands of millions of dollars in infrastructure in all the world.&&;
we two, not knew a, but composure to a thing small that could control a thing- was a lesson incredible, and not i that never would been, she.

little after of their conversation telephone of 20 minutes, a employment of summer to time part-session in.
&&; that egyptian a remarkable influence on me, was the only which had seen to that age and formed my vision of what that was a company and the well that to their employees.&&;
in became after in one of the employees of that they the laboratories of research of the company in high, where was&&; the first computer of table never fact&&;.
was so large as a, i a small screen of, and i of him.
a journey to as 12-year-old and lose the time with that machine and programmes for she.
on the innovation:
in several views of the videoed, about of new products on the march.
it in its career, it the is to sell a handful of basis, you asked a client if could they all the team.
working with only 30 days of credit, had that from the and the over of the.
more later, while was in, reminds the earlier to the that is apos in the development of a of computer:
&&; i getting of have arguments ... i which. five years& at at; for create a that 300 dollars& at the;, and i and i married look and basic a leather.
led days after, we a that composure to for 15 dollars and which was completely reliable.
on the large companies cock-eyed force:
a before of that the of, northern the in in that many leaders of the industry in its vision, and the control of their to of market.
&&; which in or, for what that described and best,? and what?&&;
you has the monopoly of the cure of market, by what that the not has more success.
the departments of sales and marketing standards the success, for what that are this class of people the the acts for you the companies and the people dealt of the products are the forum for the decision-making of decisions.
the solved of the products that was to that position of monopoly is by for of people that not have the notion of products bad products- the knowledge the necessary.
that is what that happened in ...
could have of of the industry it.
could have been ten sometimes their size, could have been the microsoft of the years 90 ...
were the defeat of the apos.
on the innovation as expression associated:
&&; emotion a enormous amount of working between a great idea and a great product ... to measure that the great idea, and growth.&&;
. you a about of the of the same.
there handouts the you which- some things that not you on which should the, the ladies the ago, the the do, the factories the do.
you that keep together things in your- these- to the time ...
the end all. reduces the they-. to to to the better that a team of human has fact, and been to of these says to the that your you doing.
associated said that the good, the large regrets.
never we had shame about of stealing large ideas.
what that in part was large the was that the people which were on in he were,, artists,, roma, that wrong were the best chemistry forgers the world.
if not would for the it, could be doing things in other camps.
and with the rival of the law of assistance paying while the court will the case
the day that the compliment particular. to door closed for at the question politically controversial of whether the it to the law of assistance paying the president obama, two of their responsible, and he, were in a dinner for the signing of lawyers that the case to the high court.
the to egyptian the last thursday, when the nine judges in met in a hearing been for to which the petitions of review.
one of the cases in question was a demand a by 26 1966 the reform total of the assistance by the congress the year last, a law that has been a did of war for the conservatives in all the country.
the responsible to concern the demand and, of fact, is they a plea historic of 5 hours and average for march, and the result probably still more the presidential apos 2012, that will in plenary peak in the time in that the decision the court. man.
the lawyer that to the court and that the law must be will probably paul, who was as tax general of us. over the government of eric bush.
the signing of lawyers of,, was one of the almost two by of companies that to the annual of the society stronghold, a group that been many years in to the defence of the principles legal conservatives.
another signed that the dinner,, represents to a of the partnerships trade the the law, the federation national of his independent.
another was the .latin., which has a enormous interest financial in the result the dispute.
the dinner. took in a hotel of washington, after of the hearing been the court on the case.
between the assistants was, between other, followed, the more important in the senate and a opponent of of the law of assistance health.
? the invited special in the dinner? and.
not is nothing new: the two judges have- to events of the society stronghold for years.
and not is i which between in conflict with the rules.
of fact, the judges are the code of behaviour that euphemistically the actions of the judges federal lower.
if not what so, could said that under the code, which says:&&; a judge can are to events for a funds of organisations attached with the law and others, although the judge not can be a speaker, a of honour, or put in the programme of, event.&&;
, however, the sheer of and to two of the of lawyers in the case, as as to a company with a enormous interest financial, was enough for to the activists of it in the government.
&&; quarter gap of the it and fighters to the code is in against of the demands of several magistrates that same the court for the same that is to all the judges&&;, office approaching edgar, the president of( he common).
&&; the judges were in a- of funds of officially with lawyers that have cases be of the court.&&;
its and assistance in the of funds for this undermines any demand of supporting, and is unacceptable.
and have shown little interest for the that which say that too easily the activity the court with the for groups as the society stronghold.
and the wife of,, is a s pharmaceutical got.
for other furthermore, the conservatives which is the bonner, the that has a problem, not and he.
worked as general of the administration obama when. were the first challenges legal to the law in the court of first instance.
their critical have for that is of see the case, saying that was too in defend the law as for now be neutral.
not has given any gives of that what will to to.

the timber 50 planes twice frontage complaint, with to 20 more.
complaint also sells six planes complaint to air, a operation valued in more of billion million of dollars.
rarely time is to when a company this a asked of 50 units of their product.
but is a great compromise when the company is the manufacturer of complaint and the price of sale for the 50 planes 2 to a record of 18 billion million of dollars.
is so large as the place of where complaint was the a: east a, a mine of gold in growth of some falling of planes.

then, the on, complaint said that air had asked six complaint, the called, which history of a savings of fuel and a services for operators such.
the price of sale for six of them is more of billion million of dollars.
&&; this clearly a enormous effect positive for complaint&&;, said the forced of.
&&; the quality of these customers in particular is very strong.&&;
many airlines of middle a are property of their nations of oil.
for what therefore, not only have the money for pay the planes, but that a increase in the prices the fuel- for what general harmful for the aspects operators, because is one of the over costs- not is so, because the country is gaining money with the increase the price the oil.
that is important because have least which other airlines of cancel or the orders of flight when the prices the fuel increase, said.

the should be what contrary are the message of that union and kid are-.
? how deception sit?
in a day who, the studies on which you can to in any place of 10 to 200 sometimes.
that sure, many of these yarns are yarns.
another study was that the three sometimes in the first 10 minutes of.
detect lies, or&&; the traceability of yarns&&;, is a prowess essential that we be all, for reasons and personal as professionals.
far of be a at of table similar to, for example,, where the aim is:&&; he i&&;, the detection the is a an the knowledge serious based in data scientists during the, six decades in universities the projects of research in depth, especially in and.
one of the results of the research is that the members about of the lie have been.
the itself who to the in.
not always,, is or.
not. can conclude not that the are difficult of detect or myths.
a of yarns can to to the truth about of the structure of the declaration, the, the training of questions and the times.
had several years the scientists on the deception in the stand and always light scanners the knowledge, and was clear that the detection the is a technical modern that is easy of a and aid to for our complex- particularly if their responsibilities professionals include the procurement, interviews, or the management of negotiations.
the good have the of read to the others, include to they, their own emotion and of a how the the others.
we for the research which the more that the, which the men say more&&; itself same&&;, while that the women say more&&; the others&&; for protect the hurt of someone which the people they least to their partners that the people which not are majority( but the lies the brutal means to be&&;&&;).
also we that if you is as a, the others. least guilty the.
? how to if someone is?
first, the care her the.
this. is&&; create a line of basis&&;.
to points of reference for operates after the changes.
part the position the, and.
is better that will if someone usually with the ordinary all the time no not to allegations as when you by the feet in half of the meeting.
to then, groups of behaviour&, and not.
to these groups of are as signals of, not as test of.
the people which can the part higher the body the to of its history, can referred their feet of the door, to a out, change its position of way significantly or a&&;&&; that of and change of position a time that all the questions difficult have is.
to often the with see that the videoed has is only for to that.
also is attention the vocabulary the.
humiliated the to the fund and the time last while which its wife killed was, a search of it to level national.
the people which also can use a language:&&; not i so sexual with that woman ... the&&; or a question difficult committed.
the indicators more common are.
someone can use a lot of&&;& quot; when to a question difficult:&&; good ... to means true ... to the that i. ... to my understand.&&;
this ago that the answer be a in instead of a fact and is to often a signal of need.
not there no at for detect lies, but develop skills for sums the deception is possible.
these skills the possibilities of who for avoid be for the artists of the mischief in their lives professionals and personal.

town of the bumpy
raphael, researchers of the front of of the, develops labelled with for produce a mixed with better-, regardless of the conditions environmental and of temperature
if the businesses which the who, not would an close of 200 thousand bumpy every season of in the area cause the valley of mexico,, researchers of the front of() of the, who was that if the process of construction and peacekeeping of a is the for, the bumpy could in amount or, even, for completely.
in its conference a opinion technological of the bumpy, in the framework the year international of the, of to of that the laboratory to its office develops from with for produce a mixed with, like to the the town, but with a greater resistance, and to quotas as to level.
that this kind of gm could used in places where the climate is extremely frozen, as some cities the northern the country, for improve its- and, for what therefore, the training of bumpy.
explain that the town, the part more the oil, is a whole of of, protect of high weight, as, and other of under weight, as, that electronic it are the its readiness behaviour.
the behaviour the town is in that to quotas, close of the u-turn degrees, is means as a tanks, to 120 degrees we its is very high and to 50 degrees we is a state almost hardest, while that to very level, the is again, quot.
the previous means that in the streets the the not is uniform, but that. is for the day of agree with the conditions environmental and of temperature, need the s in chemicals.
the researchers of the that the streets of the city of mexico in their most are covered by flexible, the which. consists of six of materials, of the which the last three the.

if. like of is still better, the engineering.
on the,, is position a last be call of, the which is nation of a material of stone fine, is say, a do that also. in town.
as. is of the when that is to be in contact with the of the vehicles, must have more force that the and that in the way.
the be the part the that will to receiving and salvage the efforts, the of required, also, have the that for and. must are the non-us the that is nation.
the climate, especially the and the of temperature, also are a factor very important to be, in special the water, said, because concerns considerably the risk of the.
when the ground., the water is in the within of the and is difficult that it, this a of all the facilitated the and, for what therefore, the training of bumpy.
in the process of training of a, said, the first in is the film of and only after is entire the, but the upset not happens, but that is a process that should to the greatly signals with mention programmes of peacekeeping.
the also member the system national of researchers which the burden is another factor important in the training of and, for this, the anything of each a of the the must go always in relationship with the burden and ensure that. we, for avoid that is them bumpy.

the proposes choose the president european for suffrage universal
the first day the congress of the union( membership), the on 14 of november, in, has been, large for applying, chancellor and president the party.
initially not. had included in the agenda the day the future of europe, but the as is imposed in autumn, in particular for satisfy to the which about that the policy the government is currently holm very be with the and could for in a future with the italians.
the motion on the presidency of the commission european, proposal for the direction, is 1925 virtually by it.
of the, so only. in nine votes in against and ten.
the of several that is, with their speeches, applying applying and, after several hours,, the minister of finance, any doubt possible.
the idea key to the chancellor, and of the motion, is short in a must: the answer to the crisis&&; not is, but more europe&&;.
not only because europe is the peace, but also because&&; million of jobs on directly the euro&&;.
for the chancellor,&&; has substance the in of open way in europe&&;.
this could practically in amendments the treaty of lisbon for a efforts the control of the union european on the political contracts of the countries of the area the euro, although also could in the election the president of the commission european by people universal for&&; a face to europe&&;.
in all case, that is a of the proposals of the motion over by the congress, clearly idea of.
, doubt, is little likely that, come quickly to a agreement on this change radical: great britain. also hostile of he and the leaders of the seem know that sarkozy also.
but the is on the ground.
for other hand, the delegates have rejected for a majority respect the proposal of the weight of each country of the directive the bank central european in function the weight of each economy, the which obviously the weight of germany.
for the hoping in the within of their party, the chancellor has increased the to konrad and. but not is that has tried to its congress to at of the&&;&&; countries europeans or of the countries in difficulties to criticise to the folly germany.
although the motion on europe yarns a is to the importance of&&; the&&;, not has to france.
is of last.
remembered that, ago two centuries, is an a bloody battle in.
of fact, was one of the most for the army of.
the which the fraud in the level for disease
after the subsidies, the and the government a pro-active against the for disease.
will the on 15 of november in bordeaux for which a box responsible of the assistance family and preference a speech on the issue, it since 2007, of the fight against the fraud social and the.
also, for she, pro-active, which part of the will of we of a properties, but still this columbus to a of the campaign presidential apos right, the most to in the in for disease.
in first place, for apply cuts budgetary: the government no impose to the workers the sector private a fourth day of before of power catch the low.
in final, is that there a convention of company specific, a worker that moment lose four days of wage, is say, a minimum of 15% of their income between.
is is of a measure that could its a groundswell of ira, but that mentioned million of eur, according them.
also, apos of other measure with a is more symbolic: impose to the officials a day of, in case of involved labour( to the at, not have we, with to the three on that is implemented in the sector private).
while in these issues, the most again to to on the table the issue the fraud, this time looking to the abuses of the level working.
&&; to considerably the controls and, also, whether is discover to someone planned a fraud, should the&&;, about in the the easter 13 of november.
the as that in the other cases, the effects the announcement seem slightly for the reality the fraud in on of in working.
of fact, since 2002. for a up constant of this question and is have it various they policies that, normally, supervision as.
the french not more that in the rest of europe.
grounds with attention, in first place, the figures national.
according the institute french of the safety social(), in 2006. more of million of eur in particular by had working.
according the institute french of research and be in economy of the health, the subsidies by the level, in 2008, on 5% the expenditure health, to million of eur.
of this a, the 46% it to the level for on and for accidents working, while the the 54% is related with the for disease, figure that 2 to million of eur.
for therefore, the 2.5% the expenditure in individual.
in 2010, the french have a average of days of involved labour, with to in 2009, a study the group soul.
a average that,, doubt, government: another survey, whatsoever in 2007 for the syrian of management professional, that the 75% of the french claimed that not had not a only day of low for disease.
one study, in this case of the, points that in 2010 the 37% of the level for disease had a one than to 8 days, the 22% of between 8 and 14 days, the 15% of between 15 days and a month, the 15% of between one and three months and the 11% were more.
if the with our neighbours european, the workers french not are more that in other areas to catch level for disease.
a long study on in 2010 for two researchers the that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of lack global the work( and for reasons of health as of another kind), in france, between the 10% and the 11%, with to a 20% and a 28% in denmark, a 15% in kingdom uk or between a 16% and a 18% in the countries netherlands.
the fraud in the level for disease not is for in compared with the work not of.
the fraud has a is quite limited.
the strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has caused that the controls of the level for disease of more of 45 on are.
in 2008, of 1.5 million of inspections, the, in a 13% of the in, which the in of actual one were&&; or sessions lots&&;, is say, cases.
in the case of the in of more of 45 days, to inspections, is was that the 11% of the cases were&&; or; a figure that, taking as this a total of 1.2 million, to.
for therefore, is was a total of cases&&;&&; of several million of workers the a low for disease.

policy energy:
the facts must& more that the dogmas
if there a issue that not. can to taking in of considerations of short long-term or simply thinking in the emotion, is the policy energy.
the prerequisites and the cost of the electricity on directly in the power applied and in the competitiveness of the companies.
is for that a i electoral be the time of on such issues and on the place of the power nuclear.
the debate only finished useful if the which of the consequences economic, social and environmental of the options proposals.
the french must its opinion in facts objectives, in data sensible.
now the are million of people in the planet, the public ageing the requires of the demand before of 2050, to least that is to a enormous part of the population world of a which is.
the same time, will that the shortage every time greater of the resources for continue and electricity now,, forget the need of reducing the emissions of developing of effect greenhouse for fight against the change climate, a issue that has should the debate ecological.
the accident of not amendment none of these.
for that, germany it one in their decision of to the power nuclear.
that not is the case and of belgium, that regions the their to the need of find a source able of, and of swiss, that only has for aim to central of last generation.
for other hand, great britain, finland, poland, republic czech, countries netherlands, sweden, africa, china, bear and brazil, for quote some examples, are forward with determination with their projects.
the states united, for its on, after s add a unit to its volume, the construction of a central after the accident of.
if the model german, based in the energy renewable, is apos in sometimes as example, the reality is in against of, speech.
the election of berlin is to mean a the price of the electricity, a greater will energy for the need of gas imported, in particularly of russia, a increase of the emissions of take by the construction of nuclear of gas and of coal.
in a months, is the influence harmful.
must on the case of denmark.
of europe in the sector, the which this the 30% of their electricity, also is one of the large users of and of gas due to the the it;& this reason, their emissions of take and the price of their electricity are, respectively, a 65% and a 50% more are that the average european.
for the contrary, thanks to the information of our policy energy, our neighbours a up of electricity a 40% higher to the of the who french.
while the in a economy globalised the cost of the energy is a factor key to the competitiveness and a guarantee the peacekeeping of the- industrial in the territory national, the companies troops is benefit of the electricity more of europe.
for that reason, any significantly of the energy nuclear that a strong increase the price of the electricity, what that to the statements on the of our country and the defence of our power applied.
is is of a price that the great most of the french in refusing to pay and, of fact, not opposition for to that kind of energy, to the surveys.
let that the policy energy of our country has lost to a sector industrial with jobs of working director and jobs.
this to the export, encompasses a galaxy of in the markets international and which can create jobs not.
if france the power nuclear, the of a part of these smes and the loss of the 6 million of eur year in exports; of equipment and services nuclear.
? what a designed for work sixty years, when is to the collapse of their manufacturer?
for, the equation of the energy nuclear, there that admit that not there a source miraculous of production of electricity, the as that not there a source.
the development for part of of practical with level emissions of take, nuclear and renewable, shows the nature raise of the sources of energy.
in the case of the energy nuclear, is essential keep the on level of security.
in france, is of a authority of security that a control more and transparent and on the central existing as on the construction of.
our history, of, are also for the security.
in a century, the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious.
so only one, the of, is in in a conditions normal; not was not for the people not for the a environment.
in chernobyl, the accident is due to design the harrisburg and to a going human.
in, some people seem forget that the accident is was to two disasters natural of a is, unprecedented, that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
the sector nuclear of this accident,, as the was of the two previous.
thanks to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security, and the operators and spoke french and germans, the apos a on able of to such.
while it all the players which want to a central, the of their construction in would a great gift for the competitors of and, since that they to free for taking the leadership in the inevitable development the sector nuclear.
is essential and legitimate to the best for our country, but would irresponsible to that the, the dogmas and the a debate so important for the situation economic, social and financial of our country.
the immigration,? a burden or a opportunity for the economy?
the policy of immigration by has been turn since various points of at: the of the services police, judicial and to the policy of allowed, the doubts of this policy with the so of&&; of the rights human&&; of france.
more recently, is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the that has to the headlines, with the minister of within( the newspaper the 23 of may) of and that france&&; not needs foreign, and&&;.
, however, rarely time. analysing since the point of view economic.
the question is that, on this issue, there quite consensus between the left-wing and the right.
in the case of the right, jacques the this in 1976 that&&; unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with close of two million of workers immigrants&&;, while that in the left-wing, the what that france&&; not can done office of of the misery the world&&; in 1990.
the only difference, the degree of generosity
in 2005, and the left-wing as the right the fear to the, the territory national for a face of poles.
to both both, is as that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society troops.
the only difference is in the degree of generosity with the that type with& to the immigrants.
in its programme,. does to include, where that the will, the&&; of the migration&&;.
this idea of the immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps is why, but its very face.
, as point the defeat and website in a you recent that reaffirm the knowledge most recent on the immigration(: world and, may of 2011, university press,.), there a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the these migration in the growth economic, the wages and the employment in the countries the immigrants.
the limit of the immigration weakened the growth and which the employment.
the fears are with the impact of the immigrants in based in the idea of that these can to the workers national, in particularly to the little, pressing for that is categories their wages.
but the experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are more well commission which substitutes of the workers national and notably professions in sectors with is of employment.
the immigrants, dumping working in sectors which not big to workers national and the more in sectors where the universities not is the demand of personal.
a effect positive on the wages
the same way that a vladmir would difficulties for work in a country that have is of, the between national and immigrants which the arrival of these last i in the wages and the employment of the national.
taking in of what previous, that a increase the 1% of the these migration a increase of the wages have to period long-term of between a and a%.
and,, have in account the fact of that the diversity that the immigrants to the creation of ideas and the fastest-growing economic( there one great proportion of billion and companies as google,,, and yahoo were held for immigrants).
the immigrants also are taxpayers to the systems social, since which of average a 1% the budget total in the countries european.
the milk the work estimated, for example, that in germany a immigrant that when with a age of 30 years a contribution( revenues least expenses) of eur to the budgets public of average during all its life.
the principle of their mandate, sarkozy wanted go to to the points of growth which he&&; jobs we&&;.
these we, that to the immigrants, freely the effect killed.
europe chance the democracy, only you is think in a democracy european
the democracy is a well precious, but also fragile.
the continent european should power of this already that, although is chance in athens ago more of two billion years, to the long the century demonstrates has suffered the kind of the war world,, the holocaust, the exalted, but also to franco in spain, to tobacco-production in portugal, the in greece.
some they that, for that the democracy definitive on their enemies, would enough exercise the vote and the way more direct possible.
we, since rostopchine&&; the beautiful&&;, that is were of something been.
the suffrage universal, although is is of a condition necessary for the democracy, not is enough for itself only and even can become in a&&; of&&;, as speak bellum the.
not, the democracy- a more: a space public, a spirit public, values, a organisation, a separation and a control of the powers, a education, fall, solidarity economic and social, justice.
the crisis that we in europe is a crisis economic, but is to point of flow in a crisis policy and democratic.
the the referendum had, to this on, a twice effect element: was the need of a signals of the sphere policy, but also the feeling of their, of their inconsistency.
must on this ambivalence for.
the truth is that the main the in of the battle democratic currently is have and that, in many cases, the soldiers armagh already not advantage in the good sense.
