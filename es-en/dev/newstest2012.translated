survey so to 900 children
the survey is was to end the last year school and took in the same almost 900 children of education basic of all czech.
already was the second edition the programme of&&; the obesity of not is a&&;, that supports the company of sure health general and the company.
to now, have participated in the project more of 12 billion children since the to the course.
a appropriate and quite exercise in family are factors, that do reduce a the number of children with obesity and even obesity.
&&; only the half of the children have would that have five served everyday according the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, and dinner, that is a of the conditions in for a healthy&&;,- one of the results of the survey.
, breakfast but with for dinner
the specialists of that, in a development healthy, are important, also, the details, that also have, as for example have a time set for the breakfast in family.
in czech, not however, only the 23% of the families of schoolchildren to the same time.
in the majority of the families, every one only.
but what worst was be that in the 10% of the who not is nothing.
the breakfast is,, however, the basis of a daily right.
the study shows that in the families of children overweight is that with many more often the potatoes.
almost all- regardless the weight- they to daily( 70%).
for rule general do sport more the 40% of the children,, however, pronounced their parents this result is reduces to least of the half, only the 15%.
your
the next stage the study that the elected( boys and girls of 13 schools) is their own epidemiological to from of all the takeover possible according their tastes and views.
&&; the preferences food of the children czech in age 25-to-30 between the 12 and 15 years, since the point of view of a food healthy, are very removed of what ideal.&&;
between their food favourite is are the, the meat and the
&&; is on all alarming the popularity of the&&;, is by in the report end the study.
as food main is for the palma the and you still of close the meat of sagrada.
virtually, the children reject always the and the will for the fish and the i is very under.
change to habits made
the same time, the study shows that the children are prepared to change their habits food if receive the information fair.
&&; in the group of control of the participants in the study, that the after of end the programme of prevention&&; the obesity not is a&&;, is was in many cases a change important to favour of the principles of a food healthy&&;, is as in the results the study.
is the attention, for example, what i to the, where many children to the water normal and aware.
the children also with more often in the the meat of sagrada and the fish for the food main and the consumption of food fresh and the derivatives of.
the has of be also a good psychologist, maintain the professionals
in the article, how about the, already i a little of that the lessons initial already were quite.
not had not idea of how would what.
conferences of three professionals the, how discussions to- problem and, also, a seminar on how works in the world the spectacle.
and will worst.
as more close are the examinations end, more information and tasks practices we
and although the course is develops every saturday and sunday, already not is a.
we time we examined with the director,,( in the course not there no man) on how discussions to the woman that not has a perfect.
and so is the great majority.
someone is, someone has a on, the right and someone suffering obesity.
the has of know reduce a shoulders, a bottleneck or the necessary
we have given certain noticed on how to i the body of women the kind of valverde, of and enormous but close and the same time not of a way too
if, for example, the difference between the and the is so that the speaking or the trousers not is, is the it done the least a paper of supported to measure.
, doubt not is, because the clothes that where perfectly is.
with a speaking to measure is ever a better that with a that not for of!,, in the, etc.
the body is can allow discussions clothes with,, or.
there certainly many types of information various and of bodies, so that i heard of that have of all the week for to order in my head all this information.
and even so, i fear that with the task, already i more that of too.
to every a in the course is you have allocated two famous, to the that must final two: one for the day and another for the night.
there that have in account the aspect current, the lifestyle of fashionable that is to the person in question.
i has&&; discussions&&; to kerr, perhaps the of the campaign of victory& apos; s.
out for within, for me is a better that, for example, or, that recently will a hundred double( for favour, have in account the excessive), or the.
the orange-coloured we that of the weeklies or in internet and, for after harmful.
the, that is as is is the result completely, this also our lifestyle personal and our relationship with the design.
is important also think in the part the.
the, for therefore, not only physically, but that also is as, for example, of the pages of products in the weeklies( of subjects specific, as trends,, making, etc.).
of all this we spoke the and designer mario.
but all this already is for the sunday.
the has of have a vision global.
the three invited specialists him the conference the saturday with information on all kind of bodies.
the, the designer of fashionable and the of fashionable ben.
we reminded that the fashionable is a illusion and the should from party to this.
and a good know work with a same of discussions of forms various.
the is, in this case, fundamental.
so, the such( or as say in english,) is can discussions to what hidden with and, but also it for discussions the body he with shoes of and as if it in reality a clothing.
or well enough and higher the bottleneck for obtain a image completely different.
&&; with this&&;, we stressed.
what that more is the next council:&&; for start to work, ago lack that first all the rules&&;.
&&; then already quot&&;, said.
for end i is clear for what all these keep, what is being with what, for what, if then is that in the weeklies of fashionable we we results different.
that, about of the.
thank the ben, i that a has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the that to.
so, for a history of fashionable that have ten pages( for therefore, ten), there that have sometimes, lists for use, the least fifteen.
and also that the fine the clothes works in combination with other, all them different to the that is mines in the reality.
all this there that times in account to the time of final the.
we s that the image and the lifestyle excessive them alone, in many cases, the half the success.
enough look to, that not is precisely a as extraordinary, but the image and the have fact of she a star world.
in czech, for the at, not there still a trend clear to use the services of the.
to the- famous also what are pointless( i mere my skills, my aspect physical not has so importance).
and when someone we our services, there that have in account that is very likely that we a stature very different to the their real( will).
then only is and physically if the weeklies the heart already have writing on the issue, if a certain has/, etc.
the sunday, and mario we in that the not you enough in the fashionable, but that has that understand of.
for their work, on all is must communicate with the people to the that, for what that is fundamental be a good psychologist.
know appreciate to the people, not is ago of least, for their views.
&&; when a director you for that you the and is what with fine, not quot take and bath-water all what that had and say:&&; what horror&&;&&;.
&&; the least a couple of things that and recommend for that someone is the can to&&;, says mario.
he same also we was that all must in the so-called&&;&&;, is say, the exchange of work.
this is set around of the and is have there all the tools necessary.
are these as nail, as nail,, or. there also will of( that you it the for the session of fine of products such that or), special of of for front, if this outside greater( the and another kind of not are, therefore could damage the fabric), or a at of remnant.
for not slogans in the usual and to something in practice, we learned to the of the shoes.
even for the part-session of fine in the study, in a surface flat, is could damage the and a more still the foreign.
and not we more that and.
not could play the shoes with the nail for not for accident.
so that had that be very.
mario i has given a joy the who my work, reserves.
the truth is that not is i are very well these skills.
this is only a small part of all the that we heard for all the end of week, in the second part the course.
already i i given account that producing the to level professional not is a way of rose-tinted, but i of exactly as what that fairly the people.
in for: the is disappear for all america.
renders
a journey, in principle, is complicates to cause of a series of of a journey routine for the time of morning.
in certain measure is managed cover the expectations, but this not it of nothing, if, in reality, not is intended to nothing so.
the new over, to the that the title is adds the, kindled large expectations already before of their.
that would new aires to the former of to for and, to as of what shown, is as a at that not should end being other time a gender of action, more.
also we we for know how disappeared the scenes, where the apos main falling the car and watch for their own ordinary.
as often happen in the of, the results not an great thing on to what that we been.
there to that is can to for volumes, but in the total is some points to cause of failures absurd, that already come in the series since ago years.
in reality not is can not calling errors, but that is is more well of the incomprehensible of the.
the adventure it very well.
is you introduces in a history, whose leading, as, has certain problems personal; for, is you offers participate in a career illegal for all america.
you the in the at east, in st which, and tardiness. mission is to the first to new york.
the idea is offer something interesting.
the route is into in ten stages and, then, in more of fifty to.
of this is follows that every career has place for a route different and the stages are in different forestry, that are quite various and interesting.
of that way, one not has not the that of that the at will always what same.
some of the forestry are even to the view, although the level technical the is equivalent the of evidence previous of the series.
for therefore, not is nothing the another world.
but the walk for the desert, the landscape or the highest mountains covered of snow are a effect about very way.
also, the to is of time in when for a element.
so, for example, in the desert you a storm of bit that ever the visibility.
in change, in the mountains there that have care for that not you a.
according that, every a of the to is very well developed.
only there a couple of models, but with that enough.
for a at, to a amount of rival( what normal in a career classical), after of win time( resolved hidden) and then you expected a resolved against a only.
in a of all this is to sometimes the police, that not ago but obstruct still more the things.
the- are the landscape outside the car.
is have when as, in the majority of the cases, has of escape of someone and you. you that, always the fair in the at fair.
nothing complicated.
is surprising,, however, that has enough least landscape in the at of what that be wait( in particular there only three).
but the result end is positive, because this element not is to be upsetting and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that do that the at it more interesting.
the model of driver still the fingerprinting of the episodes previous.
that to say that to day of today already not be great thing, but not is can that that be bad.
if a realistic, already quot to in other part.
but to a career replaced with quite action you be quite this lifestyle of driver, although we find something better between the games of the competition.
to here, all in order.
but the problems arise after of a true time.
to difference of what right of the models of driver, already not happens what same with the collisions.
of games of this kind not is wait that and collisions complicated, but of fact before of a coup against any subject, not quot predict how prosecution, with what which not all is in order.
is typical that, the to a very or able the prosecution with a traffic normal, so only has covered, but in other situations almost identical, prosecution has doing.
or even has completely destroyed.
thank the system of, not arise large problems, but can of is humour.
the are of such in that, when a accident or you of the back, the at you the last point of rescue in the back.
, however, in every career only is at of five available.
if the all, you that restart the career since the principle.
so therefore not is more that a aid in case of that something not will well, but not is very of.
to sometimes, not the aid, only aid the the stage on of memory.
a great disadvantage the at is that the ourselves facts is are in different places.
in some, for example, there that into of a way specific; of another way, are being of take.
other sometimes you in some get vehicles&&; civil&&; always with the same configuration, although the first, or five minutes before or after.
this ago of on all in situations, when that two that will the i in directions diametrically, your, problems, but when, or well direct.
is as when, because is programmed for that the&&; surprise&&; always will front of military.
the adversaries have also a advantage more.
for all the starting to websites where,, have in account the at, always you the same in the same get.
also this happens the end of the starting, in a long bridge, what which is still more.
must to before that you., the price that be.
when is front of you., you difficult the vision of the that come of with, so that the principle quot to the car.
is can understand the idea of create a at with maximum takes of and, but the execution is so apparent that surely you delay.
and is a it, because although the model the journey be simple, the at is fun and with action, of way that to often not is possible to the detail what that is not where.
and really of as, if the merit is for the idea with fifty runs standardise or the classification in the career for that not the platitude, or any other thing.
a idea is the change of for the to.
you that be to to the of petrol the on of the road, because exactly there you that change of prosecution, although in the great majority of the cases you suffice what that you.
the is into in three categories.
the quot are& for areas urban, the strong american for the motorways and the for a driver technical, for example, for roads of mountain with.
also will main also is a will of challenges parallel, is say, there to in places specific that for the stories.
here not only medals, but also points of experience for profile, that it therefore for the challenges as the.
the achieve the level higher, the driver is you open several for, beginning for the prosecution and with funds for the profile.
the same time, there a role in line, that highlights results with the of other players and other duties community.
one of the elements more difficult of understand is how is nation the last career in the history.
with the car to the tunnel the metre( satisfied), where you to can to shameful for the to( satisfied).
the you mark between 150 and 200 km/ h( satisfied) and, of suddenly, for behind you is the the metre and is you for for front, more.
in the significant surely we a discussion on this for several days, on if for the programming the at none was even a little or if the authors of truth we take for a buffoons of.
the part technical the at not is nothing so, but the least the effects general are in the majority of the cases, to sometimes to.
therefore what it that, in the at more is reduces the quality of image and, in times, of a way serious.
this affects on all to the accidents where there many participants, when the quality of image continual already not is valid.
the audio is well and the such is a question of tastes.
to end of that be the welcome to the greater part the group youth, the such belongs to the category&&; every one of their father and of their mother&&;, but is can mean that nobody agonising the at only for their music.
the that end of for: the is therefore quite confused.
if the at errors absolutely his, we we problems in that that the is the better at of of the last years.
of the that of that the at not is concluded.
the is, but because the errors you back in the eyes with the force of a of airport.

&&; not i than that is a war, legutiano&&;.
&&; heavy five, six years, before of that the situation is a little, is and the new players is to their new papers&&;, so began with conviction their conference in the faculty of right the her czech to the eu,.
how not issue in seriously their s&&; clear and openly on europe&&;, that said already in the first part of their conference, when managed under every body of the eu and their relations with such precision and clarity, therefore would the of many lecturers of the faculty of right of the.
also the work of the new president permanent the council european, will rompuy:

the new since of representative of the policy foreign and security is it to from of the question:&&;? who is this eu?? to what number i?&&;. is is therefore of a step important towards the unification and the clarification of of the union policy of face to states as china or india.
nobody to the cheese of
is has occupied also of the agenda was, still and will the council european in the future next.
the presidency czech of ago two years was a success.
the czech is dublin of the crisis economic light, through the crisis the gas and organised a summit for the partnership eastern.
the fall the government in at at is lighthouse as a aspect very negative, that affecting seriously to czech.
the representation czech in the eu has for the at many commitments.
in words of the her:&&; a good fuss&&;, not only the presidency, but also the crisis financial, that is is trying now.
for another on, there that approve the budget for seven years of the eu, caused for the current situation economic, a more difficult.
if the budget is more simple and effective,? what sectors will priority, what countries will greater support and what least? that is something that will present in the agenda of the next meeting.
the her reminded also their main, with the that came to europe:&&; about of europe with clarity&&;.
&&; what true is that not i them the, the or the that the people not understand&&;.
&&;? how can a citizen understand that in brussels not is busy of truth the curvature the curvature or, bananas of various sizes or that nobody we is to ban the cheese of?&&;.
also to from more from the environment of the eu and closer to more citizens czech to the institutions european.
we expected the europe of the multi-speed
according the her, the czech have reputation of eurosceptics and the people can more well the aspects negative that the positive.
also, the low participation of the czech in the institutions european.
the fault is of a of factors, as the of our candidates, their inability for write messages of motivation, but also the little support of the czech.
also the success of the presidency czech, it of highlighted the force and the cooperation the group of.
&&; that when who to me a polish and a hungarian and is i about a who, a french to my on i says:&&;? what, already you been, the the group of?&&;, and is is that not you ago no grace&&;.

how have out the prices of the travel since 1989
to 1989 had in the czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travel state you:,,, and.
the agencies of travel of at at in the majority of the cases travel only the bloc socialist, therefore the travel to west were very.
the tourists czech would, for therefore, of holiday to the beaches of the case( republic democratic german), to the union soviet,( in in the sea black) to bulgaria and romania( both in the sea black) and to hungary().
a exception positive was the period for between 1962 and 1972, when is could travel to yugoslavia,, however, after the regime is towards the east and the travel of the tourists czech were then quite.
a great- the socialism was the fact that to the citizens the bloc socialist( or be, also to the) not is them travel free and processing not even for the countries socialists.
if a citizen wanted travel processing, for example, to poland or to the union soviet, needed a letter of invitation, if not, the journey individual not was possible.
the agencies of journey in those times also travel the east, but one is should to to the eu with a together of eye and to so all the night, or have&&; good known&&; in the agency.
still so not all was cattle.
the so-called&&; promise of change&&; that was the condition for the travel the east, not is to the&&; people politically little reliable&&;, that so not could travel in at.
the currency not was a currency freely tell and,, guarantee of change, not was possible obtain the resources( the currency western) for travel to west.
the great majority of the czech experience their holiday in their own country, for what that had a great number of infestation and houses of summer, that the czech. this in still there.
the way of travel of the czech has suffered since 1989 a real revolution.
while that to 1989 for us was the not is more to the holiday in the case or bulgaria, the year last the czech did 4.5 million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world.
is great-, of the that today day already not we aware, the fact of that the destination currently favourite, croatia, to 1989 not is could travel freely, because was part of the yugoslavia of then.
to principles of the years 90 is imposed the exemption of visa for travel to the states neighbours of europe western, what that resulted a wave huge of visits of shorter long-term, to vienna or germany.
the, for a time, not is his of the the east, all the world wanted it the what least for a at.
for example, in paris the groups of czech in the parks in shops of campaign, already that our income of then not we pay a hotel or pension.
a feature typical of the czech of at time was the be for the food( canned, packaging, etc.) for save.
another at important was the introduction of the of the contain czech, so our tourists could finally, after of decades, buy freely currency western.
our level of life and with he also the wages media, what that around of 1997 resulted a increase in the demand of travel.
with the increase of the demand of travel they the agencies, to from of 1997 with addressed, to preparation the travel using the establishments of flights, what that was down incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the last, thank to the possibility of obtain health-conscious for the volume of passengers.
to end of the 90 the century last, already the czech themselves, visa to almost all the countries developed, are us., what which still more our travel.
another at interesting in the history the tourism happened already in the 2000, when was organised, thank to a huge demand, the first flight direct since czech to a country, and was to thailand.
since at year, proceed all the years flights direct with tourists czech was countries distant and. this winter already is directly since czech to 12 destinations.
the countries the their currently close of 100 billion czech the year.
another at interesting of this time, that symbolises our development, came in the year 2008.
the 17 of november of 2008, us. squeezed the visa for the tourists czech, with what that our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world.
in 2008 the czech, for first time in their history, have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad(%) and for first time in their history, is have spent in travel the abroad more of 15 billion billion czech for head, including the expenditure in the get of they.
gift house general ordinary for choose the president, that could end of new in point died.
since ago almost five months the football czech is, president and is likely that the successor of safronov as president of the federation czech of(), not is not after the call of the next house general extraordinary that will place this thursday in.
of fact, still not is has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to to.
, the same, not is will vote even for choose between the three candidates.
the interested to the football czech are, and.
to their office in june not, before rectify to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that longer the football in the future.
, however, after of conclude the was, is used a controversy between the two of the partnership unable of to to a agreement for decisions a candidate common.
this became in fact the 16 of september when had that be elected the new president.
the delegates of the house general is met in vain in the home national(), on in the area of, because the discussions is had blocked and not only in as the method of election.
not is came to no consensus not in as to who in the house general had right to vote- only the representatives legal or also the delegates with a powers.
to from of that at and because to this only point, is in a agreement-, supported also for the recommendation the institute of state and right, according the which the representation for a powers not is possible.
, however, the disputes on the code electoral are open.
more light on the situation already not could should not the committee executive that, in their meetings, or extraordinary, all not preah nothing.
the opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already, but the point ourselves still being the same.
the question is the next:? of what way proceed in the third round for avoid the point died?
&&; the dispute revolves in about to if is must proceed of agreement with the or find another model&&;, says, one of the three of the, that, since the direction of the partnership, represents the professional.
according the model proposed in the, in the third round going at candidate that have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will their candidacy.
the region of czk is ready to to to a compromise for that can win at candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both.
the part bohemia,, however, which the condition of that the winner, according these are, should have the majority of the least two thirds.
&&; this you,, however, the sense to the two rounds previous and for completely the concept of system&&;, so is as understand the concerns of the part, according what which what better would not play the order and vote according the files.
with what said, quickly, is of agreement also, although is is that the regulation electoral established for the of all the candidates be more to.
&&; i like that is the maximum of agreement with the&&;.
&&; for that not is no about of the representatives as in the last house general&&;, says the you of victory, that is for first time as candidate and that at their comments mainly in against of.
still being achieve.
according he, in is decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future of way constructive.
&&; all the is with the party of today of our team national in the championship european.
&&; the football will to be leading, and so is more to will&&; says the representative the, that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football, therefore to level professional as regional.
is the more promote.
&&; i that is it to a agreement, but, for unfortunately, the situation is a more difficult.&&;
&&; not is is the conflict between and, but there attempts of the rules to their own convenience.&&;
&&; this can have as result a new deadlock of the house general.&&;
&&; of all case, i that is present the sense common&&;, said.
already not is a time for that all the parties are to a agreement.
some negotiations had that take in montenegro, but? who can know to that start the party if the team of football will completely?
the air special, in the that had that travel to, between other the and, not has the this morning for problems technical in prague, taking that other a alternative for carry to part the committee executive the place where will place the party of classification.
the meeting decisive, for end, could be the that will place to level ministerial, that, according have, is will this wednesday.
to, minister of education, youth and sports, you like a integrate to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful the country for that is it to a agreement.
there a in at: the benefits state, the credibility the football and also the next house general the committee central of the federation the sport() that aim made of a new direction the sport czech after the problems financial of the home of.
for achieve the presidency, because not is a candidate more appropriate.
if the head of the of,, before of the house general extraordinary the name of a candidate appropriate that all their ideas on the new president of the federation czech of football(), not is would as candidate to a since so relevant.
&&; if would a person appropriate, would fighting for she and not i would as candidate to the elections.&&;
&&; but to the day of today not is has been find a person so&&;, said for the agency of news czech()
what that justifies to to into in the challenge with and is exactly the possibility of block to, the course winner of the elections, that opens the way to the presidency of the federation czech of().
also that, in case through, in the office of president only to 2013, when long-overdue the time of the house general ordinary.
in that office you like see to a expert and good workforce that not is too related with the events fans.
&&; already i about with some people to the that could have in account&&;.
&&; for me was a madness hear to some say that in this at not even want identify with the football czech.&&;
&&; i like change that vision&&;, adds.
what that supposed more bother to in this at is the relationship of with the president of the partnership of football regional of apos, a man with a last controversial, known outside the as a with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the house general.
for is so unacceptable see to at in the presidential.
&&; in case of that, is nazarbayev the status to and nothing in the football will&&;.
&&; with the support of, a man of business ambitious, the football sorry still least from&&;, said.
; also the fact of that ago a years the name of was related with a usual telephone for the research of a case of corruption, of the which went.
&&; not i what prestige the football could bring the victory of.&&;
&&; and with what eyes we plead the uefa and the fifa&&;, said, that also decision-making with certain caution their declaration previous that&&; the club if is become in president&&;.
in the case of win the elections the thursday, could be the cooperation with in the future.
of same opinion is the another candidate,, that has been supported for before of the house general of september that end in a.
&&; he() would the first the that represent&&;.
&&; is very capable.&&;
&&; i what could imagine, for example, as head of the representation&&;.
&&; but not as workforce of a partnership&&;.
&&; i not the there where not i i capable&&;, added, that in september many attention for support the from of the commission of referees for, potential after for.
accepts that is to manage the partnership.
for to their capacities of management of the companies private, therefore since the summer last is also the director the, that with their support took in may the in first division.
&&; i force for change some things in the area of football and make to their practice safe.&&;
&&; for reduce the influence of some groups of pressure, that probably tend to influence in the decisions the committee docked and of appeal, have situations unpleasant, said, so their towards the president the daniel.
a of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the and the committee czech, with the aid the which pressure on the leaders political for that disproportionately more money the sport of the tax of the i.
&&; is one of the problems key the that is should for the new president.&&;
&&; if the tax on the games of gambling, as what the parties political, support their arguments, but, frankly, have that us where is to stop all this money&&;, out.
, now not has in account even their partnership with the club, although he same says that the president of the must be&&; not she&&;.
is to their time related with and with of prague.
&&; not is ideal.&&;
&&; but not i sense the fact of yield hypocritically my actions the club of to other person for then again there after a year and a&&;, said.
promised to the new that with the point died of the elections.
two days before of the house general of the partnership of football one of the candidates to the presidency,, promised that, in case of be elected, coordinating that the had a new that definitely for as, in the future, the controversy in as the regulation electoral.
the representative the is achieve in as to the meeting of this thursday in, and believes that the conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory the team of football.
already before of the elections not made in september, promised firstly, in case of be elected, precisely in the representation and in tax-raising funds.
decided participate in the last minute in the last house general, for what that this be of two months you could go well for defend and it, in a context more broader, their ideas on the management the football.
&&; the people of all the levels is as the football already ago a time and expected know this thursday the new president.&&;
&&; feel that has come the time of that someone the partnership&&;, think the man that is couples mainly with the club of, but that worked in the and in the committee executive of the partnership.
for this reason, believes have enough experience for manage the football czech.
is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that hung in the time of safronov.
&&; unfortunately, in the house general of june were adopted the that not were so absolutely as all run-up.&&;
&&; if certain interpretations, we a president already since september&&;, emergency.
exactly the the document more important of the partnership aids is as for who to the delegates.
&&; if i president, i what counts as a challenge personal and i prepared to respond in case of that this.&&;
&&; is a question of principles,, the which not we there&&;, says.
also, in theory, is not over with their opponents.
already in the last had your that is was asylum with, the that respects for their training in right, being aware of that their would also their first vice-president.
already was a time, attack to he who, the contrary of, not he larger with head.
&&; for more of a year in the world of football, and already has achieved some successes.&&;
&&; their attacks but were and many people became amazed for the campaign electoral.&&;
&&; for that many of them on their real nature&&;, said to their flee, that still being faithful to the statements announced already in september.
their weapon more powerful is, according he, their knowledge the football, since the apos more in to the with.
this last should be of promotion the football.
&&; also, as all the that ems to cause of the as result the scandal of corruption the year last.&&;
&&; immediately after i in the negotiations with the sector public and the private, for ensure that has enough money for all the football&&;, said ago two months to the the candidate of 46 years.
to continuation also promised that their appointment as president the football not no change personal of the.
&&; would that know first the tasks of every he&&;, said she to where, after a long period of, has a comprehensible.
to despite of the scenarios doomsday current that is to the next house general, he believes that the delegates not travel in vain this thursday to.
&&; if the only point of disagreement will how vote in the third round,, doubt what we overcome.
&&; the football needs credibility, the which is will only if for end has a leader&&;, still two days before of the apos more decisive in their career of representative, still being achieve.
enforce, that under their leadership, the to work with to.
if in the quarter house general its elected the current vice-president as new president of the partnership of football czech, many people is and surely.
enforce that, in case of be elected, is hard.
to implement a change systematic and to that the member the committee executive are responsible of every area the football processing.
also is compromises to resolve the case of the, improve the relations with the uefa and the fifa, to more money for the football and continue with the work on for the previous president safronov.
&&; as president, i like producing for completely the football&&;.
&&; since the contacts international with the uefa and the fifa to the selection, and for the football professional or the numbers of young of high performance.&&;
&&; with this not i say that what would all only&&;, said in a interview for the.
&&; i a player of team and i stick the powers the committee executive of such way that every member can their to a area taxation.&&;
&&; and tasks difficult for that the football can, in every one of these, to forward with a momentum&&;.
&&; to many people this probably not you, because busies start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the others&&;, added.
because to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement, is says that has have the possibility of not stand of new as candidate.
&&; all know, that work 20 hours everyday.&&;
&&; but need know that this will sense and that not will people behind of my that i – and to every step&&;, he so the for of their.
&&; many people i has said that not i asked for zero, because then is give for also the others&&;.
&&; is is of have faith for not leave so,, more&&;, said.
according say, you justifies also continue the work that already began with.
&&; for these two years, is end a great part the work that not i that now is resolve&&;.
&&; there processes that is had started and that will their effect within of a couple of years and not i like that someone the&&;, announced concerned for the fact of that, if the another candidate,, the situation in the partnership could again to be such as was before of the time of.
&&; i i in the order, and is something that, in my opinion, not is capable of keep.
&&; behind of he is on all all that people that is the football for that outside only a privileged for a few elected.&&;
&&; is i can a lot of things, but not the fact of that i to favour of someone.&&;
&&; attempt be aim.&&;
&&; i to a football for all, because only so is well all and not only the elected&&;, said.
this also the idea that only serious karlsbad the president.
&&; although some people seeking that what contrary, i in mind to what maximum for czk.&&;
&&; for example, is time of think in the fact of stick the second division in a part czech and in other, whose winners to the first division&&;.
&&; not is would the situation current in the that we only three equipment of czk, what that represents a problem for the players young&&;, said.
although to the of the elections presidential is, president the club, not is of believe in their for of be elected.
&&; still i have a strong support of the federation czech, the which i was as their vice-president and that know that behind of me there successes clear&&;, said, whose successes understand the savings of a tens of million of billion of contracts, the negotiations of contracts and the negotiations on the law of the i.
for another on, recognised their part of fault in that the federation not is united.
and while civilized that is&&; for to the confidence in the football czech&&;, as the another rival,, as a candidate strong that yes has something that offer the football.
&&; nobody can for that was a great work for the at year&&;.
&&; in the case of that be elected, probably will what that already began safronov and not of way significantly the the personal in the committees.&&;
&&; not i use that to my favour&&;, so to their rival.

in turkey and in the population german of origin turkish is has negatively with fear and concern to this news.
for many germans of origin turkish which a that is i died ago time, since the attacks with in of fires in in november of 1992 and in in may of 1993, not had happened more episodes of violence with background of extreme right against turks.
not however, never is has questioned that in germany there xenophobia.
the network lb reveals a scale whose dimensions not were, not a least,.
&&;? again to the ideology bloody?&&;, the edition for internet the newspaper turkish&&;&&;.
the newspaper&&;&&; for the contrary that one of the authors the crime was a – of the office federal of defence of the constitution and is shows concerned for that the authorities german can be involved in the.

is clear how is estimated the value of a person according the amount of their tax.
the information current of the media turks again to show what thorough that is, since then, the mistrust of many germans of origin turkish in the legality of this country.
also the effort of a explanation wider and of a the terrorism of extreme right in germany, this time do lack words.
the bank the scandal the along of
the bank more of europe not is is in italy not france, if not in switzerland.
the almost she in in the crisis financial and since then is of a crisis to the next.
now the at a german.
sure that max not what had thought.
after of their witnessed starting of the summit the bank federal, in july is through that in 2013 in a new and almost also of witnessed work: president the council administrative the great bank blessing, a and lucrative step in their career.
max is am should, whatever switzerland for their beauty and to the for their would acquired strength and is we comments on their future colleagues.
&&; the bait has achieved a revival&&;.
&&; i am cooperate with and&&;.
in september became clear that all would completely different.
a for financial of the bait in london prevented all the systems of security the bank and 1.7 billion million of eur.
, director general of the bait, a banker not only known in switzerland, had that come.
the president the council administrative of the bait is was since then also, and all activated:? when is max?
is through that max must advise the bank since february of 2012.
and is will office of the presidency the council administrative in may, not to principles of 2013, as the bank the tuesday.
this is hard for max.
not is banker, more well, professor of economy and and has had a period of adjustment surely necessary.
of coup is ago responsible of the strategy of a bank, that has of again to prove that deserves the title&&; the greater bank the scandal of europe&&; since ago time.
for a part, the bait is huge, to ago little was the greater administrator of goods world, and for other part, since ago years, is of a scandal the next.
nothing, so what seems, is you the changed so proud bank blessing.
started the crisis financial.
the bait had a reputation excellent to 2007.
the image the administrator of goods blessing and hardest, but also, is with objectives ambitious, also wanted be a great number in the banks of investment.
for a part, with ones billion of dollars, the bait managed more money of customers wealthiest that any another bank the world.
and for other part, as bank of investment in the league of the large banks the world.
this.
hans, the former banker and and professor of in for many years it:&&; to my students, always i described to the bait as model of a good bank.&&;
&&; since the point of view current, one is question:? how could?&&;
was in a great mistake.
in the year 2007 went to the light that something went very is in the bait.
to middle of year, bit, director general, that to then was have as a banker and very intelligent, resigned quickly.
some months after, is the reason.
the fund of investment the bank is in losses with titles of high risk and had that thousands of million.
for should with this, the bait announced a of capital of nothing least that of 13 billion million of frf.
for this found investors, course that some with contemptuous to little before: a fund state asian and of singapore and a fund state arab, so, that never is had heard their name.
this was only the first coup.
in april of 2008,.
the bank had that on the loss of thousands of million,, president the council administrative, in 2006 in the second better paid council administrative of switzerland, resigned.
in october of 2008, she the disaster, in view of their investment wrong, the is found in the crisis financial to the dear and had that be for the state.
the bank national values problem to the for many thousands of million, the confederation was six thousands of million of frf for a carried tell, by the that is in the bank.
all switzerland was affected, is stated what dramatic that was this for a country small, if to banks so large.
finally the sum the balance of the in 2007 was more of five sometimes greater that the results economic of switzerland( see).
&&; not we again to rescue to the&&;, said, expert in.
to the first disaster is joined the second.
few months after, the in a conflict tax with america and is was ready to limits the data of the customers wealthiest, that possibly had tax with aid the bank.
also, whereby a figure of 780 thousands of million of dollars, point of profits of these business with a compensation for payment.
with this, the more or least have helped in the fraud tax.
slaughters lost something that had been since always their capital in the competition for customers rich: the of discretion.
after the scandal, the secret the bank blessing already not is the same.
to this continued the- the president of the junta directive and the president the council administrative.
and the led of the funds of the customers.
of this way, in few months the bank lost their credibility in their two sectors central: in the of investment by the speculation flawed and in the administration of goods by the aid the fraud tax.
and fair when heard to be something more relaxed, fair when is i that the heard to this, is this history the for, a for individual 1.7 billion million of eur, before of that the bank is account of that something was is.
and is, for what seen, this still not works well with the management of risk in the of investment.
&&; with the case is to that the controls of risk have changed too little&&;, says martin, professor of economy and finance in the institute banking of the university of.
the director financial of a great bank german also is sure:&&; the problem of the is that not dominates the controls of risk&&;.
for what that about the idea of the caution, with the that the bankers swiss is were since ago time, be the watch of the are goods the world: no risk too large, in change, the security the money to the another on of the republic sanctity.
the brains of security of the banks swiss were the symbol of the reliability, as and the chocolate genuine.
the central of the in not dovetails with the buzz the hardest bank private blessing, only is a little greater.
the situation is classical.
the bank has their headquarters main in the street of, that is since the station main directly the along of, for the summits covered of snow of the mountains.
here the buildings are, the housing are a of the more higher of europe.
here is are as between business traditional swiss as the.
here they since ago years the banks swiss: since the bank national, and for the palacio of, to the banks private as.
is will in the room of reception of the by a disproportionately door chair.
within the walls are of, front is are large of such, together the logo the bank there a great for indicate the&&; security&&;.
the know what that the client search here: security.
the two large banks swiss, the and, in some at have the idea the great bank blessing, or the have betrayed, as view the president of a small bank private blessing.
prefer not read their name in the newspaper, the end and the out ago, as all the bankers swiss, also with the business of both large banks.
the is has fact too large, view, mainly in the of investment, where the penal have cattle ground.
there the swiss not had nothing more that say.
&&; and is have have for a time to the our of the penal.&&;
of fact, the changed the of investment with, handed their first great proposed and then wine the disaster, no entity financial european had lost therefore money in the the high risk as the great bank blessing.
the 15 of october of 2008, the disaster was clear.
&&; that wednesday the coalition government the small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation&&;, says the author in their book&&; de&&;(&&; the of the&&; in spanish).
the political granted to consolidated thousands of million of frf or approximately 45 thousands of million of eur for save the great bank of the.
? how is them happens?
is about with the bankers swiss, so are the problem in the dimension of the.
in june of 1998, two of the three large banks swiss is in a consortium.
from a bank that, because to the merger, was too large for the small switzerland, and still growing.
for what that was for that the two different banks so-called of the is: a bank rico but doesn with the centre of the administration of goods in and a more poor but more strong.
of suddenly, the banks of investment came of way well with a money, with the that could to a great bicycle financial.
there two names related with this increase of the: bit, head the consortium of the of 2001 to 2007, and, then president the council administrative.
&&; always i that and were a team perfect&&;, says the expert in hans.
&&;, the intellectual, modest, that understand a of models and statistics, and, the that managed greece step since the learning in the bank to the summit.&&;
finally, is of.
and the end was probably a mistake decisive:&&; was that their models were a reality&&;, says.
&&; is a case tragic.&&;
tragic, perhaps.
is clear: the came before the case.
the employees of the is remember clearly of the meetings of that, in the that, the head the consortium, always the same s: down the better to sink sachs.
the bank american was the bank of investment more the world.
the&&;&&;, the that then the success of the banks.
the wanted be in the summit.
some steps you forthcoming well.
in the operations of and in the negotiating of actions was in what more high.
, however, the can of companies makers put of highlighted a point weak: in the business the interest international, in the language of&&;&&;, there a compensation huge for the large banks.
the has in the products american.
for fill these, the started a adventure that almost you costs their existence.
or of growth, therefore the same bank as one of their funds of high risk created in investment american of high risk.
is taskforce in a machine powerful for appropriations american and to continuation, certain risks to account own.
and also, as other banks arrived the for a time.
&&; in summer of 2007, as the market estate american was in, the there&&;, said, expert in.
so large the euphoria, so thorough the fall.
a workforce had that go, already that the attempt of one was more complicated of what that expecting.
the jobs in the is became in seats and are to the today.
currently, who at a great bank, has a work almost impossible.
must find a strategy for a bank, to the that all the models of business are stumbling.
, expert in banks, has a idea, to end to the of investment, focus in the administration of goods, return to the roots.
the bank not to to so far( still).
but the of investment must reduce a, is clear currently.
the next thursday,, the new president the bank, will their future strategy the world.
in reality, only is was in the of 51 years as a solution penalisation, already that the bank the bank is quickly of their predecessor.
meanwhile, he is imposed: must you of way permanent the business of the, the bank of the tuesday.
to restore the bank of investment to their state to middle of the nineties.
makes jobs.
but this not enough.
the needs a vision.
? who is?
? with what to win money?
these are the questions that sure is ago max currently.
to the at only says that first a housing with their woman in.
the next year.

mission action, the congress prepared for to to a agreement on libya
seems that finally republicans and democrats in the are prepared to only of agreement on something related with the embargo in libya.
all what that is needed was that the rebellion had success, that the off dictator the gaddafi outside attempted and murdered and the participation of states united came to their end.
the tuesday, the committee of affairs foreign the senate is to be a resolution, for the president john( democrat for), together with the john( for coldest) and joseph( independent for), to the who for their successful rebellion and to the troops of us. for their&&; courage&&;.
&&; this resolution is for to the of libya, the start to rebuild their country&&;, said.
&&; is a claim of support for their s democratic.&&;
the language can appear, but nothing on the debate on libya has been easy to now.
this summer, the legislators of both parties is between yes and with the home white on the significant of a series of resolutions for approve or reject the role of the military of us. in the mission of the nato in libya.
in june, and tabled a resolution that forming the use limited of forces military of us. in libya.
the project of law was in the house for a broader for, and that never came to in the senate.
but the same day in that the project of law was rejected in the house, the house also rejected a measure that would the funds for the operations americans in libya.
what he the mission of us. in a kind of purgatory legislative- with the congress what enough upsetting as for criticise the within for part of obama of the mission, but not so as for in reality the under their feet.
to continuation, the the congress was for the events.
fell in hands of the rebels who in august, and gaddafi was murdered the 20 of october.
the mission of the nato end officially the 31 of october.
now the senate could be completed for act.
the resolution the committee of affairs foreign&&; welcomes the people of libya for their courage and extraordinary resistance for explained to yes ourselves&&; and&&; whatever to the men and women of the forces armed of states united and to their partners of the coalition that took in operations military for protect the people of libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism&&;.
the resolution also&&; states the interest national of the states united in a successful and commitment transition towards the democracy in libya.&&;
? going the new measure the completely support of the commission of affairs foreign, or to the legislators as was the project of law of june?
the last version was rejected for the senator richard place(), the main the committee.
the spokesman of place said the monday that not had seen still the version end the new project of law.
the another on the, the house is to vote this week on a amendment constitutional demanding a budget approve, a priority legislative for almost all the republicans and some democrats.
the measure, for the giving( for the), will the first amendment constitutional on the budget or any another issue that of fact a vote of all the house in the house or the senate in this congress.
other legislators not have had success to the at for to to their amendments to the house, but not for lack of attempts.
the of is only a of the consolidated amendments constitutional that is have austria in this congress, that a wider range of subjects.
some are- the same project of law is proposes therefore in the house as in the senate- and other with small exchange between yes.
there for what least 15 versions of the amendment the balance budgetary so only in the house, and another handful that&&; fucino the expenditure federal.&&;
some of these projects of law also are between yes, but are to their- on all republicans job that for their- the opportunity of of that them were the&&; authors&&; of this measure.
the law of control of budget, that was adopted in august, that therefore the house as the senate voted a amendment the balance budgetary.
in march, 58 voted to favour of a resolution not binding that supports the idea of that amendment.
more beyond the budget, several member want limit the number of that the member the congress can to, while that the representative josé 672( democrat for new york), to ought the limit of two for the presidents.
the representative used.( democrat for illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that an the right to a education of quality and attention health, between other subjects.
a amendment that from the marriage homosexual is a proposal, so as a that from the burning of flags.
some legislators also want allow the acts of the laws federal if are been for two thirds of the states.
so enthusiasts that have been the member to the time of propose amendments, not is are mean to a pace more quickly that in years previous.
in the congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and tabled 66 in the.
the pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the the of 1990, when the member were regularly more of 150 amendments every two years, according figures for the library the senate.
but not had a more success then of what that what have now.
the last amendment that is added- the 27- was ratified in 1992, but of fact was proposal for the congress in.

a official military of high senior in the by, also known as the then president the state greater whole, the, was the role of the troops of way different.
&&; the were as a kind of child&&;, wrote the official in a e-mail electronic.
i sure of that the organizers they good intentions.
is that the they.
but not was respect, of truth. was.
the from at incompatibility the difficult relationship that is has sign of the military and a public us to often, to sometimes,.
is to the troops with praise for their sacrifices.
but the has a price, say the member the service.
the public every time more it as if you it those.
&&; not we victims in at&&;, said the general of brigade are, who the troops in iraq and soon towards afghanistan.
&&; but seems that the only way of that some willingness their support is put to us in the role of souls.&&;
the issue is a issue very sensitive for the leaders military, that not want appear or in disagreement with the public the that serve.
also is are account of that the ira to the that is the troops that were in the last years of the war of vietnam was a worst.
as result, the majority of the discussions on the is have to out in silence and in private between the of war.
after of that their two children were of combat with the of marina, the colonel withdrawn mark them emergency of that the people from of the military considered their service since two prospects.

the achievements in the field of battle are rarely time elected for the for part of a country that has little with the military and is few profits direct of the wars of iraq and afghanistan.
&&; us, as nation, already not we the military of ways that were the all common in the second war world&&;, said the deputy general withdrawn david, who the troops of us. in afghanistan.
in change, the praise of the political and the public is substantial in great measure in the depth the suffering of a member the service.

also says that since february, is have since in contact with she close of 400 survivors more, many of the which could be part of future demands.
their strategy: in place of earned to all the complainant in this case, by all the eggs in a same basket, for so say, is to it several cases, of be necessary, for keep the pressure.
the team of the defence for the department of defence, for the tax federal launched, has have a motion for presented the case.
the documents the court, and for, below the strategy of defence- essence, that the military not can be for soldiers current or old for the injury violations in the forces armed.
for a ruling the court supreme of 1950s so-called the entailed, the government federal not is responsible for the damage for the personal in service active.
&&; the damage are part the service military of the complainant&&;, say the documents.
the department of defence is refused to to comments for this article.
the things have changed since the years 50.
while that to the women still them is officially ban serve in which, this distinction is only we: the wars modern rarely time have clear the lines the with.
therefore in iraq as in afghanistan, the equipment of women soldier are papers every time more important, especially for to to the women local in areas of war.
the result: between these two wars, 150 women soldier have died and two thirds of them in situations of which.
is time of that the army also is, says.

the walls have eyes: how the researchers you are at in facebook
before of become in the new face of the extreme right in europe, anders was simply another kind that their points of view in line.
the monday,, who deed have done a killing in norway in july, that he 77 dead, is; to their first hearing legal public.
while can have action only, was far of be only in the: had last the greater part the time that concertation to their attack with to their computer, with some of the million of nationalists that support to the groups of right in networks social.
after of the tragedy of this summer, the researchers wanted know more about of these people.
but,? how?
easy- only you that into in facebook.
&&; we we account of that not was so difficult to to them&&;, says, author main of a report published recently on the populism digital european for the centre of studies british let.
the of information personal of facebook is so, says, that the researchers could simply use the tool of advertising for determine their characteristics with a precision scientific- the way that the sellers have state being for years.
the team of found a million of fan of the groups of right in all europe and then them announcements, but in place of to a new such or product of, the announcements to the users to complete a survey that he on their level education, attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future.
the to to through of facebook, and their colleagues were able of to to more of, followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 countries european- all, out of the office.
&&; is a in completely new of to a research&&;, says.
some of the results not are the all surprising: the supporters in line of the groups of right tend to be young, men and for the immigration.
, however, in a kind of accordance,&&; those that combined their in line with the outside of line are more reasonable, more democratic and least violent that those that is are behind of the screen the computer&&;.
the work of let is only a example of how facebook is is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists.
centres of research, researchers doctors and scientists political are being the get for to all, since problems of health to trends social such as is s in the&&; i like&&;, messages in the walls and updates of state.
with more of 800 million of users active a average of three parts of content the day, the&&; of data&&; of facebook is; a on of the research, pushing the number of jobs academic with the name the get in the title to almost a 800% in the last five years.
for some researchers, the beauty of facebook is that you allows to to the people to the that not with a in the street.
&&; before, when to people the party national british, was very difficult.&&;
&&; that go to through the party, and them never you 10.6 the access&&;, says.
&&; facebook would all that- you to them directly.&&;
other say that the get could provide a way of identify and address the problems of.
a study recent done for the nice, of the university of and their colleagues, found that the students it that they of their of in facebook they a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that the students that go in silence on the issue.
nice suggests that the colleagues of the students, such as the advisers, could control the get and intervene for help to a student that requires too updates of state with their table.
&&; not you treat a problem if not what you&&;, said apollinaire, the of nice and director the centre of health, behaviour and development the child in the institute of research child of seattle, said the washington post.
&&; we found a way of identify children in risk that of another way not would.&&;
facebook also is constantly&&;&&; to their own population for obtain data.
the team of data the get has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the day of st on, the expectation of participation electoral to half the period legislative of 2010, and a rate of wish national( mainly being the information to the that is can access- defenders of the freedom digital ago a time that maintain that the get should to to available of other their great amount of data for the research).
, however, the users of facebook know that the get them is looking, them whether or not- the for power around the with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the get your information personal.
but? what is when the users of facebook spend to be part of a survey that not even know?
while that the researchers have guidelines well public on how up their data outside of line, in line is a free for all.
&&; not i that many of the users have thought even in the fact of that a scientists could be examining their profiles&&;, says launched, a reminded the laboratory of knowledge of london, on a study of 2006 that was to out with the walls public of facebook of students.
&&; in what that to them give, was only between them and their friends.&&;
then is the question of the methodology.
even outside of line, not there guarantee of that a issue of research this being completely honest.
in facebook, is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and of the messages the wall are truth.
&&; what that in facebook and what that hardly outside of facebook are two things completely different&&;, says.
is for that that, to despite of their years as scientists of the technology, believes that a and a are being the best tools of research that nobody can use.
&&; not there substitute for into in the world real and about with the people real&&;, says.
&&; the research social is is that is on what social- and a lot of what social still is outside of line.&&;
&&; cold and inhuman: anders ago their first emergence public in the court
anders, the man that be the brain of the two attacks that killed to 77 people in norway this summer, is has to to yes same as a of the&&; resistance&&; for their first emergence public in the court of oslo.
&&; i a commander military in the movement of resistance norwegian and in the apos of norway&&;, said to a room full with 500 people.
&&; i am the court, already that received the mandate of the organisations that support the ideology the hatred and because supports the.&&;
&&; i the facts but not i session guilty.&&;
the judge was to for that, because&&; not wanted to to the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform for that their points of view&&;.
for the same reason is refused to allow to, that brought a speech writing with early, house to the family of their victims the end of the hearing.
also issued to the police keep to under custody for 12 weeks more, you teacher the access to the media of communication for four weeks, and said that the authorities should that have a narrower control on all the visits and the for eight weeks.
around of 30 survivors and family of the victims speakers to the hearing.
some as with the hope of look to to the eyes, other for confirm that is is under key.
all speakers with the aim of move towards the conclusion.
&&; i that seemed cold and inhuman&&;, said a of to the selected norway.
&&; was you, but for me was a step forward after of see and hear the suspect.&&;
clothing with a suit dark and point blue, is remained and professional to what long of the hearing and to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when she and went the building.
to despite of the strange notion of of be part of a movement of&&; resistance&&; greater, the judge that not is a ill mental, and said that not there evidence of that while with.
is possible that to some them that the attacks the 22 of july unimaginable be labour of a in place of a group of radical.
but that not automatically the pain and the confusion that all a nation still feel.
&&; i like that existence a monster, but not what seems&&;, said a family of a victim.
&&; would a more easy if what existence.&&;

after the death of, the 5 of october, there some that what with ford- the out of the technology as the great modern.
but what that the fan of could find more intend, in a interview to recently to the that is has as embargo of a series of special in the are markets this week, is how about this mind about of the processes trade and flows of work of the products.
was, doubt a designer, and, but also was a whoever and a of the of flow- a man that i that many place&&; a disease that is in think that a great idea is the 90 for% the work ...& at at; but& at the; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.&&;
in 1995, giving was developing the series of television the of the( the of the) on the the computer personal, and is laid for more of a time with for a can and rarely conversation.
in that at had last young 10 years since that had been forced to leave of, and already working turn in their new company it, waiting the adoption popular of internet.

was only after of the death of that is found a copy full in in the garage the director.
this material of for, slightly, is the basis of: the interview delayed, of consolidated minutes, that is to the this wednesday and thursday.
for someone known for the interviews in depth, here seems quickly prepared to forward their appeared and strategies trade.
and very.
in four points different to what long of the interview, there large between the questions and the answers- of 10 to 15 seconds of, where is clearly their thoughts, for precision.
also there at in the that the of its to the surface, where seems because to the questions of, to go more quickly towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance.
before of the was of, the or the, there something in the interview delayed, when what that is that other companies do well and is, and offers their own vision the future of the it.
a thing is read assessments of the career of, but there something oil and in the that we here, the the on of the greatness.
he has a vision of as can and must be the things.
not a after of all with detail here, was and what was.
a quickly short of seven in of the interview delayed:
on how to to a business:
&&; to what long of the years in the business, i always he:&&;&&;? for what hardly things?&&; and the answers that you are of in are:&&; oh, that is only the way as is ago&&;.
nobody know for what ago what that ago, in the business nobody think in the things very deeply.
that is what that i.
for the detail their efforts for simplify the accounting of.
for the in in is the costs- to often beginning with a&&; cost standard&&; that is was to eye of good, and that then is position with a&&; one&&;- developed a factory that that could determine the costs trade the detail.
on the joke the pope:
the&&; box blue&&; that he same was with- a has that did to the people effectively the company telephone and to so-called to long distance free.
is has writing widely about the has, but the euphoria of here the under the box blue as a act of is.
describes how he and the box by the use of a telephone public, doing a so-called, and then since a network of&; ts to other, while a with the greater amount of satellite possible.
&&; were the things around the world a average dozen of sometimes and to through the telephone public and heard a minute more later the telephone public of the door of the on&&;, says with a.
&&; we young and what that learn was that could build something us ourselves that could control thousands of million of dollars in infrastructure in all the world.&&;
us two, not knew a, but could build a thing small that could control a thing giant- was a lesson incredible, and not i that never would said, she.
continues a joke that he and almost fall, the vatican to through of the box blue in half of the night and through about with the pope, while was their better imitation of asked.
to measure that several member of the hierarchy catholic were in half of the night for about with the diplomatic us, the two in fair before of that the pope outside reawakened for go to answer the telephone.
on of the technology( and the sale for telephone with garage):
to the age of 12 years, to the hunting of parts of spare for build a of often, arrived to garage in the guide telephone and you was a so-called.
little after of their conversation telephone of 20 minutes, managed a employment of summer to time- in consultancies.
&&; that was a remarkable influence on me, was the only company that had seen to that age and formed my vision of what that was a company and what well that to their employees.&&;
is became after in one of the employees of that they the laboratories of research of the company in high, where was&&; the first computer of table never fact&&;.
was so large as a alarms, had a small screen of, and i of he.
a journey to as adolescent and lose the time with that machine and programmes for she.
on the innovation:
in several points of the interview, about about of difficult new products on the into.
soon in their career, already that is he to sell a handful of numberplates basis, you asked a client if could they all the team.
working with only 30 days of credit, had that physically the and the over of the equipment.
more later, while was in, reminds the struggles to the that is; in the development of a of computer:
&&; i agreement of have arguments dramatic ... i that is be five years& at at; for create a that 300 dollars& at the;, and i and i i outside and i a designer.
nineties days after, had a that could build for 15 dollars and that was completely reliable.
on the large companies losing force:
a before of that the apos of, foresaw the in in that many leaders of the industry in their vision, and the control of their share of market.
&&; realised that in or, for what that hardly and best,? and what?&&;
you has the monopoly of the share of market, for what that the company not has more success.
the departments of sales and marketing increase the success, for what that are this class of people the that end for you the companies and the people spreading of the products are the forum for the decision-making of decisions.
the out of the products that was to that position of monopoly is for fault of people that not have the notion of good products one products- the knowledge the profession necessary.
that is what that happened in ...
could have of all the industry it.
could have been ten sometimes their size, could have been the microsoft of the years 90 ...
were the defeat of the victory.
on the innovation as expression pablo:

as detect a lie
a telecommunications to the headlines more recent we points undesirable serious and curse are the deception and the lie in the life daily.
the candidate presidential is occupied accusations of harassment sexual with several women; every part accused of lie to the other.
the administrators of the university state of pennsylvania have been accused of for supposed conceal reports that were that a you of football withdrawn was sexually to children.
the week last, the president french, taxpayers sarkozy, was&&;&&; with a off open saying the president of us., barack obama, that the first minister israeli acknowledge netanyahu is a do.

the former candidate presidential john has been accused of breaches in the funding of the campaign relating with the of a relationship.
and, of new, nobody that what never the circus up for the president garage clinton the lie for their second mandate about of their relationship sexual with.
are very the myths on the traps in the examinations of the school and the university.
is have given cases in the that the teachers have given the answers of the examinations to the students with the end of be better seen in their assessments of performance.
that should be what contrary are sending the message of that lie and is are volumes.
? how deception we we?
in a day who, the studies show that you can lie in any place of 10 to 200 sometimes.
that sure, many of these lies are lies.
another study was that the issue three sometimes in the first 10 minutes of.
detect lies, or&&; the in of lies&&;, is a as essential that we acquire all, for reasons therefore personal as professionals.
far of be a at of table similar to, for example,, where the aim is:&&; you i&&;, the detection the deception is a an the knowledge serious based in data scientists and for the last six decades in universities that post-election projects of research in depth, especially in and.
one of the results of the research is that the old about of the lie have been.
the yes who to the eyes.
not always,, is or.
not is can conclude not that the are difficult of detect or unmasked.
a of lies holds can to to the truth to about of the structure of the declaration, the, the training of questions and the times.
i several years the scientists on the deception in the spectre and always light body the knowledge, and was clear that the detection the deception is a technical modern that is easy of learn and aid to advice for our complex world- especially if their responsibilities professionals include the procurement, interviews, or the management of negotiations.
the good have the as of read well to the others, legitimate feel to will, their own emotion and of in how the were the others.
we for the research that the more that the, that the men say more&&; lies win towards yes ourselves&&;, while that the women say more lies&&; win towards the others&&; normally for protect the feelings of someone that the people married least responding to their partners that the people that not are married( but the lies that usually say tend to be&&; enormous&&;).
also we that if you is insightful as a, the others is least guilty the.
? how know if someone is?
first, contempt the behaviour her the highly.
this is is&&; create a line of basis&&;.
aid to provide points of reference for measure after the changes.
contempt the position the highly, and feature blues.
is better that will if someone normally with the ordinary all the time for not to accusations upon when you see the feet in half of the meeting.
to continuation, groups of behaviour sell, and not.
basic to these groups of behaviour as signals of alarm, not as test of deception.
the people that dealers can freeze the part higher the body the treat of remember their history, can emphasized their feet towards the door, towards a exit, change their position of way significantly or a&&;&&; that root of and change of position a time that all the questions difficult have over.
to often the do see that the interview has over only for to that.
also happening attention the vocabulary the highly.
behind the to the fund and the time last while tenders that their wife murdered was, a for of she to level national.
the people that dealers also can use a language:&&; not i relations sexual with that woman ... the&&; or repeat a question difficult accomplished.
the indicators more common are.
someone can use a lot of&&; language been&&; when says to a question difficult:&&; good ... to say truth ... to what that i is ... to my understand.&&;
this ago that the answer be a in place of a fact and is to often a signal of vigilant.
not there no formula for detect lies, but develop skills for be the deception is possible.
these skills will the for of who for avoid be for the artists of the mischief in their lives professionals and personal.

? park or mountain?
the architects line in the opportunity of the call more beyond of controversial on docked
the contest municipal on the 16 doors the debate on the role of in barcelona
of the 80, in plenary for of the already s cause of barcelona(), this administration a of promotion of.
the the mountain as the great park of the barcelona cause.
is more, is of a compared, in figures, with the central.
with the death of the, in turned, the park came to, in the, of many, as the limit higher of barcelona, being the capital of the few that not is in the s north-south but down( mountain)( sea).
the opinion of as park natural apos in this idea.
the reference already not was central but, with the in the role the.
in these is was to that, in september, the lives a an for 16 competition for other many doors of access to.
a door planned to the idea of park,, doubt.
or that or someone to to doors the field.
the question its single:,? park or mountain?
the contest, therefore for their it merely as for what that is of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects.
is almost already a issue recurrent the that it hand when two member of this former form of elected is recognise in a lift.
and this fact of ordinary, exactly, to a of the few between what that opinion three architects, and teachers it, that is have have.
miguel, daniel and: the contest is right.
for, after addressed the with low-lying&&; is ago necessary&&; discuss on&&; the with of mountain&&;, all time that the speech of, the of the 10 greens, not is has taken to out.
&&; is from of the basis of that the park more endemic of barcelona is the a.
between other things for their great.
is more complex&&;, ruling the architect for who the title of&&; doors of&&; within a&&; trap&&;: not there that think in them&&; as the to a park, but the of a areas where there that act&&;.
, as and with experience in the world, described the proposal of&&; challenge intellectual&&; with&&; some dangers&&;.
dangers derivatives of what&&; uncertain that is today day tried the space public&&; after the experience in the 80 and that had in the area the&&; their enemy the&&;.
the first fear is the own of a borders on where is can build.
&&; limit something is them already the next step&&;, is say, their.
&&; there that think in new instruments, of planning, because the current& at at; in reference the plan general()& at the; can to ordinary to disasters&&;.
more to the question, view that,, the it of&&; can should as a park, the of barcelona, not&&;, for a question merely.
reminds that already there a work fact for the of that&&; not must we in together wish&&;, although thanks the opportunity that the lives offers to their of intervene in this project&&; since the first at&&;.
and still more, understand that the of the mountain with the city is the produced that allows to the architects into in the debate, but&&; doubt&&; on if is this profile technical the that must lead the equipment(&&; all a rightly&&;, as) that is have had that create:&&; the architects should be only a tool&&;.
nothing that the answer to the question that of title to this one is complex, because in the foundations the contest lack a vision global of:&&; is have blessing 16 competition direct in the sense, but not there a reading, that see and understands the area in their whole&&;.
this from, the least in their case, that has choice for participate in the 16 competition.
of another way, a project for a of the doors can in programme and definition with the the architect of the door of the on.
in their opinion, that yes, the lives should ensure that the strip immediately higher to the round of should at, in all their spread, a area of that a softly transition between the city and what green.

the secretary publishing of details the accident air where lost the life the secretary of, which, and seven people more
the of communications and transport() informed that the results onto on the accident where lost the life the secretary of, which, and seven people more, show that the helicopter is of way direct on the ground in full integrity structural,, that the pilot could try a landing;.
for a conference of press, publishing, secretary of communications and transport, mentioned that before of controllers the, the pilot discovered that the conditions of climate were the right for fly.
&&; the elements that seem indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the&&;.
also informed that the unit was sewn for 19 people, for what that had with the necessary for carry the personal.
also, said that in the research made in the area the impact not is the emergence of parts in the ground.
&&; in a for is our that not there parts or components of the in another place, the impact is presented of in structural.
&&; the design the helicopter was for 19 passengers, had with& for to the passengers.
the ground is a outstanding of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of gradient.
for the at, the secretary s that is a priority have with the results before possible;, however, the research can last several months, even could achieve a year.
for their part, valverde archibald, director general of airports and services diagnoses, s that the at the impact, the helicopter the state greater presidential in at of cruise and that this happened in a ground ascending.
&&; this information strengthens the of a operation normal of cruise the at the impact&&;, expressed.
in the conference of press, the region of the, publishing, six element relevant in the research:
flight about:
with to the ôhe the flight is was under the rules of flight about, this means that the must have visibility for the flight and the ground.
conditions likely:
the in the conditions right the sleep, with is the towards the area bordering between the and the state of mexico is were ground of to low at.
routes:
is likely that for the conditions of the has a area of will raising and greater visibility towards the valley of.
location the impact.
the of impact and the last registration of the the radar line, probably before the impact not there loss of control not at in the very of flight.
of remains of the in a area reduced:
the information available to the at it mean that the impact happened in a very straight and of on.
the of of remains of the it mean that the helicopter is in the ground in conditions of integrity structural.

is protocol for finding gene of obesity
at the sure social a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young; is supported in specialists the
the institute mexican the sure social() announced that at a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young, so-called protocol& apos; genetic of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence& apos;, that will have with with the obesity.
in a release, the head of the unit of research medical in the hospital of the centre doctor national century 21st, miguel cross valverde, he that is taken a team of doctors, nurses, and workers social.
said team is supported for specialists and a of the institute national of health public() and the centre of research and of studies advanced() the institute national().
in the research is foot to participate to the population be or not, come to the units sporting participants the in the valley of mexico, where is have to out the evidence to the under, all the i to from of the 8: a.m hours.
skills that the protocol started in the unit integrating( state of mexico) and that since the 8 of october, the activity is for to out in the unit integrating( state of mexico east).
a time that is a the aim of together to 500 or 600 under, the study promoting in the unit integrating independence( southern the district federal) and finally in the unit integrating( the north the district federal).
he that the purpose of this research is know the components and the importance of the genetic with on the development of the obesity and identify in children and young mexican factors of risk for prevent the emergence of diseases disturbed.
the have this 14 of november the day world of the disease, that the aim is together to three billion children and young between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific on food.
also is them on the activity physical and background of diseases, with the purpose of avoid factors of risk that as disease or inadequacy.
that the i is them applies to all the participants measurements( weight, stature, circumference of), decision-making of pressure blood, determination of the levels of,, and insulin and genetic( is search identify genes that is to the obesity child).
cross valverde pointed that this research of to the concern of the professionals of the health for the alarming increase of weight in the under.
& apos; the surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 signal that in so only six years there a increase, in the case of the children, of 77 for% in obesity, and of the girls of 47 for%; in terms of obesity also is observed a rise dramatic& apos;, skills the specialist the.
pressed that the justification for the for of the is in that the population the country from of other for their history genetic.
informed that in average, the mexican has 65 for% of inheritance indian american, 30 for% european and five for% african and this condition is reflects in the genes that is take to disease and too of weight.
he that of way general, the genetic of the obesity is translates in the inability of regulation the too of energy that( lowcalorie) and that is hold in in of blubber.
the scientists he that the benefit direct for the participants is the assessment contained of the children, what that allows detect if have some degree of obesity or obesity.
even, said, the presence of of colour() in bottleneck and, that show the likelihood of that and to.
the information is apos of in confidential, the doctors the for writing to the parents, to who is them it every a of the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle of life that must to for prevent diseases.
cross valverde he that there three components main that cause obesity, obesity and other: the, that is the lack of activity physical daily, remain the greater part the day at with the television and use media of transport in place of with travel planes.
also is must to the high, is say, the greater consumption of alcohol, of(, bread,, hamburger, etc) with high content in fat and chickens and the genetic that is analysing in this protocol.
asphalt of the bumpy
raphael, scientists of the faculty of chemistry of the, develops which with for produce a a with better every, regardless of the conditions environmental and of temperature
if the signals that middle the;-, not would necessary close of 200 billion bumpy every season of dry in the area cause the valley of mexico, emergency raphael, scientists of the faculty of chemistry() of the, who s that if the process of construction and peacekeeping of a is the appropriate, the bumpy could radioactivity in amount or, even, be for completely.
in their conference a opinion technological of the bumpy, in the framework the year international of the chemistry, was to know that the laboratory to their office develops which with for produce a a with characteristics like to the the asphalt, but with a greater resistance mechanics, therefore to highest as to in temperatures.
that this kind of which could used in places where the climate is extremely a, as some cities the north the country, for improve their every and, for what therefore, the training of bumpy.
he that the asphalt, the part more disproportionately the oil, is a whole of of, a of high weight, so-called, and other of under weight, so-called, that electronic you are the their readiness behaviour.
the behaviour the asphalt is in that to highest temperatures, close of the u-turn degrees, is means as a tanks, to 120 degrees degree their is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost hardest, while that to temperatures very in, the asphalt is again, added.
what previous means that in the streets the resistance the asphalt not is uniform, but that is is added for the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and of temperature, emergency the specialist in engineering chemistry.
the scientists of the observed that the streets of the city of mexico in their majority are covered for flexible, the which is consists of six ground of materials, of the which the last three the asphalt.
between the ground more is is the, for small stones in asphalt and then.
every a of the that is the, pointed, is with asphalt.
the the vehicles and efforts, this allows that the forces is are very well in the.
if is like of asphalt amended is still better, opinion the draughtsman chemical.
on the,, is put a last as so-called of, the which is nation of a material of stone fine, is say, a bit that also is in asphalt.
as is is of the as that is to be in contact with the of the vehicles, must have more force mechanics that the and provide in the way.
the be the part the that is to receive and salvage the efforts, the of required, also, have the thick appropriate and is must they the material the that is nation.
the climate, especially the moisture and the exchange of temperature, also are a factor very important to be, in special the water, said, because affects significantly the every of the.
when the ground is, the water is you in the internal of the and is difficult that from, this level a of all the ground the and, for what therefore, the training of bumpy.
in the process of training of a, said, the first in is the film of and only after is affects the, but the damage not happens, but that is a process that should to the first signals with& programmes of peacekeeping.
the also member the system national of researchers he that the burden is another factor important in the training of bumpy and, for this, the thick of every a of the ground the must go always in relationship with the burden and ensure that is a, for avoid that is train bumpy responding.
raphael emergency that still there a that with and work on the asphalt, for example, the, that in other countries already is are even in the market and it the bumpy with easily and, need of use highest temperatures.
? what you latter to the cresson the valley for be the new colombia?
analysis of the factors that for that not the contain of colombia.
the valley a their title number 14 of princess.
of new the valley the is is with the to of the contain of colombia.
this time is had that shaping with be in the of, the contain of silver and the such that the as new princess of colombia.

today the great question that many is do is? what latter?
because the result represents the defeat of a great that in every presentation proved that she had all for be the new colombia, not in vain was is as of the police and better face of, titles that value as or who is were the contain of colombia.
the first factor that is as key in the decision that took the jury of first princess latter in that not with their answer to the question&&;? what is that book that you has there to you and for what? nation for, of the.
the the replied:
&&; shall a, i quite in the literature, i that is a in of, definitely i that the book that i cause of childhood is&&; the&&;, is a book quite their.
currently shall&&; crime and punishment&&;, is a book of literature universal that all we read; and today in day i read the book of, a russian, a book that is is&&; the of the blood&&;&&;.
a answer that little pleased first for the term&&;&&; and second for not explain of way particular of what way every one of the books that the have there.
but the by the ceremony manifested your relaxed and happy with the result&&; the universe is is what that has that to.
and for all the people, for favour read a,&&; the&&; is a great book&&;
between the walk is says that to valley the the.
a journalist that the be the kotler, the and the cresson that is was all the awarding required( challenge of, vote the public for the better suit notions, and as mother),&&; that kindled the of the other has, to the as and for that not in the stage&&;.
and that is in their first presentation in suit of it in the a the and their two in the evening of.
although in both safe, is that you missing the force and the impetus that the representatives of and atlantic yes mission.
ariel, journalist the programme&&; as in home&&;, the channel opinion that the fact of that outside impression princess&&; fallen that the cresson that more awarding earns for the contest not is as as&&;.
also, valley is was to what last very with the press, and there is.
other is that valley not in convince the jury on their interest towards the work social, that is in last, the essence the contest national of beauty.
for something, two days before of the election the jury international manifested that them a woman with the needs social of their.
&&; the beauty single not enough in a colombia, there that look region beyond of what physical and firstly in their sensitivity social, that before of imply the contest are already in projects&&;, he.
also is that valley for their flaws in the and the that is you in their, but is audience therefore precisely the jury the was as the cresson& apos; beauty natural& apos; with the body more healthy, good food and work physical responsible.
the of george recognised that not had the better body, that had best,&&; but their problem of in the, that the truth for my not was very, you given points in the last day&&;.
between therefore the journalist guido, of the magazine as that the mistake of the were the speeches that is.
&&; the are well, but valley not is the it to.
their body never was their strong and here is the&&;.
for this prize, that for first time over the contest national of the beauty, after the raised in suit of it about a humane that is properly, therefore is said that this was the that you to for not should the will of the contain.
reality or not, what true is that since today it a year of, not as sovereign, but as princess, position that you offered the possibility of represent to colombia in one of the international for designation the own contest national.
, however, she will to the history as a of the that to despite of their step for, you was the contain.
so was the work the that lighthouse the of
a of happened to the history as the man that this the death of&&;&&;.
the work of these officials is key.
the last 4 of november a the of happened to the history as the man that this the identity the maximum head of the:&&;&&;, to through the of their fingerprinting digital.
of the seven that in the the, that week you the time of&&; availability&&; to gonzález, a man of port that for 21 years working in the area of research legal.
the an their career, gonzález worked in municipalities the from, where many sometimes had that for more of five days in the jungle for to the get in the that were the bodies that be be at.
in the 2000 is found to the capital the valley and, then of to the courses appropriate, is in, that is the study of the fur of, is say, of the of the hands and of the feet.
the week the operational against to you warned that on clothes minimum for three days.
something large you than.
the friday in the night went for the in a helicopter since.
was that should identify two bodies and that is that one of them was the man that respected to the more former the world, for what that you ’ that on the card of psychologist a( their real name).
, however, when came with the team of research the get in the that is was the not what recognised for their aspect physical, therefore was very different the that had seen in the media of communication.
was,, clothing as a plead of the area,, glasses and a more young.
but the fingerprinting not.
linked of a, ink, a and a, the from fingerprints the with the of the card.
their eye not you: was&&;&&;.
that same night, the man of port was the responsibility of the minister of defence, juan charles, that yes is was the maximum head of the.
in for of the left
for a of the of the recognition that was the president juan manuel resort to gonzález, in the wheel of press for the operational against&&;&&;, is very significant.
many people not known our work.
the is a science accurate,, for of mistake, that can to to be key in the resolution of crimes.
from of the identification of bodies, the support research for crimes as and murder and chicago the identity of the people.
when is aliens, many criminals have nothing or not have papers.
us them we the impression and the look in the basis of data.
the scientists romanian that, in a case of, you ought a part of wall of a home, therefore in that place the do had supported their hand for from a box strong full of and money.
&&; the walls are difficult because not are land for from a impression, but in that case we obtain the left of all the hand and identify the criminal, that had participated in different&&;, reminded.
the fingerprinting also can seeking or reaffirm suspected in cases of murder.
ago little found to a man died, with bottles of to their around.
for a of the research is that a family could be suspect the crime and, indeed, a left in the bottleneck.
although this not does that has been the murderer, yes what in the scene the crime.
a the he that in the these&&; the fingerprinting is with chemical or physical&&;.
when officer, is used a or launch for.
then of this, the from are settlement to the, that is the basis of data, or to the.
&&; the problem is that still there many dead-end xenophobic&&;, pressed the expert the.
that not all is as is shows in the programme of television.
so as not all what that which is gold, not all what that is is is again left.

japan after the earthquake
the gdp overall a 1.5% thank the consumption share and being end to the spiral of that set in march
since the last month of march the economy macroeconomic is was paralysed, still for the devastating earthquake that became in a crisis nuclear, the worst disaster that the country since the ii war world.
the first estimates the government of the losses materials in 300 million of dollars, a coup that, despite the difficult context world, seems have.
after of three quarters of, the fact the product internal gross between july and september was for to indeed, definitely: the gdp is a 1.5% in compared with the quarter previous and a 6% in rate.
the reported in the second quarter- for the japanese, the year tax beginning in march of 2012- is, also, the greater pace of growth since the period of january to march of 2010.
the recovery is it, in part, for the of the buying of machinery for restored the areas for the and the and tsunami.
of fact, the companies by their investment in a 1.1%, with the declining the% in expenditure of capital that is observed of january to march, the first been after of six months of startling.
, however, the real of the economy macroeconomic not is on exclusively in the momentum- that foot to take the crisis for strengthen- or rebuild- the infrastructure, of the shortcomings for grow since zero.
japan has reawakened, on all, thank to the development the consumption share, that in the today represents the 60% the gdp.
this one a 1%, for the increase the expenditure in vehicles, travel and activities of leisure.
the stigma the
is has the market internal, when the- the currency- is has become in one of the&&; values refuge&&; for the investors that fleeing of the crisis of debt in the area euro and the shady forecasts of us., a privileged that is as a in the accounts of the companies.
with a motto more strong, the products are more expensive in the abroad, a seriously reverse for a country whose line of economic next certain for the health of the large groups behavioural.
kind or, for example, their weak results between july and september to the prices the.
while the markets are with their to the countries inner-city of the eu, the government of not low the in.
&&; there that be to to the risks that massive, as the deterioration of some economies foreign, the impact of the floods of thailand and the fast opinion the&&;, pointed yesterday the secretary of state of policy economic,.
and, in effect, the prospects not are encouraging.
the organisation for the cooperation and the development economic( oecd) that the majority of the countries member tabled in september signs more of squarely economic.

the badge proposes choose the president european for suffrage universal
the first day the congress of the union( badge), the monday 14 of november, in thumbs, has appropriations, large difficulties for withdraw nomination, chancellor and president the party.
p.m. not is had including in the order the day the future of europe, but the issue is imposed in autumn, in particular for satisfy to the fighters that they that the policy the government is currently too little strict with the greeks and could become in a future with the italian.
the motion on the presidency of the commission european, proposal for the direction, is adopted virtually for unanimity.
of the delegates, so only is committed nine votes in against and ten.
the of several minutes that is, with their speeches, withdraw nomination and, after several hours,, the minister of finance, any doubt possible.
the idea key of the chancellor, and of the motion, is short in a s: the answer to the crisis&&; not is least europe, but more europe&&;.
not only because europe is the peace, but also because&&; nine million of jobs on directly the euro&&;.
for the chancellor,&&; has come the time of open way in europe&&;.
this could practically in amendments the treaty of lisbon for allow strengthen the control of the union european on the policies budgetary of the countries of the area the euro, although also could in the election the president of the commission european for suffrage universal for&&; should a face to europe&&;.
in all case, that is a of the proposals of the motion adopted for the congress, clearly idea of.
, doubt, is little likely that the bringing are quickly to a agreement on this change radical: great britain is shows hostile to he and the leaders of the badge seem know that sarkozy also.
but the accept is on the ground.
for another on, the delegates have rejected for a majority won the proposal of the weight of every country of the directive the bank central european in role the weight of every economy, what which obviously the weight of germany.
for the encouraged in the internal of their party, the chancellor has increased the we to konrad and. but not is that has tried who to their congress to at of the&&; small&&; countries european or of the countries in difficulties prepared to criticise to the arrogant germany.
although the motion on europe he a paragraph to the importance of&&; the friendship&&;, withdraw nomination not has to france.
unless of last.
still that, ago two centuries, is in a bloody battle in thumbs.
of fact, was a of the more examinations for the army of rostopchine.
the impact the fraud in the in for disease
after the benefits, the and the government a for against the in for disease.
sarkozy will the tuesday 15 of november in bordeaux for visit a box responsible of the benefits family and pronounce a speech on the issue, already recurrent since 2007, of the fight against the fraud social and the.
also, for- such for, that part of the will of save of in thorough, but still so reminds to a s of the campaign presidential of right, the majority to firstly in the in for disease.
in first place, for apply cuts budgetary: the government for impose to the workers the sector private a fourth day of we before of power take the low.
in final, unless that there a convention of company specific, a worker that ill lose four days of wage, is say, a minimum the 15% of their income month.
is is of a measure that could on a wave of ira, but that would save million of eur, according them.
also, would accompanied of other measure with a reach more symbolic: impose to the officials a day of we, remains in case of low labour( to the at, not have we, with to the three days that is apply in the sector private).
while is these issues, the majority again to to on the table also the issue the fraud, this time looking towards the abuses of the in labour.
&&; will to significantly the controls and, also, if is which to someone obviously a fraud, must the&&;, emergency about in the the sunday 13 of november.
the as that in the other cases, the effects the announcement seem slightly for the reality the fraud in on of in labour.
of fact, since 2002 is for a monitoring constant of this question and is have it various offensive policies that, normally, have given as.
the french not more that in the rest of europe.
handed with attention, in first place, the figures national.
according the institute french of the security social(), in 2006 is more of million of eur in particular for in labour.
according the institute french of research and background in economy of the health, the benefits for the in, in 2008, the 5% the expenditure health, to million of eur.
of this sum, the 46% is to the in for leave and for accidents labour, while that the 54% is related with the in for disease, figure that out to million of eur.
for therefore, the 2.5% the expenditure in health.
in 2010, the french have a average of days of low labour, with to in 2009, according a study the group soul.
a average that,, doubt, behind government: other survey, published in 2007 for the syrian of management professional, that the 75% of the workers french prevent that not had not a only day of low for disease.
another study, in this case of the, points that in 2010 the 37% of the in for disease had a long-term than to 8 days, the 22% of between 8 and 14 days, the 15% of between 15 days and a month, the 15% of between one and three months and the 11% were more extended.
if the compared with our neighbours european, the workers french not are more that in other areas to take in for disease.
a long study done in 2010 for two researchers the top that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of lack global the work( therefore for reasons of health as of another kind), in france, between the 10% and the 11%, with to a 20% and a 28% in denmark, a 15% in kingdom uk or between a 16% and a 18% in the countries netherlands.
the fraud in the in for disease not is especially significant in compared with the work not of.
the fraud has a reach quite limited.
the forward of the legislation, since 2002, has caused that the controls of the in for disease of more of 45 days are.
in 2008, of 1.5 million of inspections, the, in a 13% of the by, that the in of shorter long-term were&&; unjustified or too we&&;, is say, cases.
in the case of the in of more of 45 days, untreated to inspections, is was that the 11% of the cases were&&; rightly or; a figure that, taking as starting a total of 1.2 million, out to.
for therefore, is high a total of cases&&;&&; between several million of workers that a low for disease.
, doubt, a figure minor in compared, for example, with the work in black.
according the member of the, author of a report on this question in june, this practice will a losses of income tax of between and 15 million of eur the year, is say, more that the cost total of the benefits for in and,, doubt, significantly more that the fraud in this last area.

policy energy:
the facts must assert more that the undistorted
if there a issue that not is can treat taking in account considerations of short long-term or simply thinking in the emotion, is the policy energy.
the availability and the cost of the electricity on directly in the power purchasing and in the competitiveness of the companies.
is appropriate that a i electoral be the at of think on such issues and on the place of the energy nuclear.
the debate only will useful if investigated the whole of the consequences economic, social and environmental of the options proposals.
the french must shoulder their opinion in facts objectives, in data conservativism.
now that we million of people in the planet, the development demographic some the duplication of the demand we before of 2050, to least that is to a huge part of the population world of a element vital.
the same time, will that reverse the shortage every time greater of the resources pollution for to have electricity,,, forget the need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse for fight against the change climate, a issue that has disappeared the debate ecological.
the accident of not change none of these parameters.
for that, germany it single in their decision of up to the energy nuclear.
that not is the case not of belgium, that hearing the their to the need of find a source capable of, not of switzerland, that only has for aim build central of last generation.
for another on, great britain, finland, poland, republic czech, countries netherlands, sweden, south, china, india and brazil, for quote some examples, are forward with determination with their projects.
the states united, for their on, after you add a unit to their park, the construction of a central after the accident of.
if the model german, based in the energy renewable, is is in times as example, the reality is in against of such speech.
the election of berlin is to mean a the price of the electricity, a greater on energy for the need of gas imported, in particular of russia, a increase of the emissions of co2 for the construction of central of gas and of coal.
in a months, is the effects harmful.
must on the case of denmark.
of europe in the sector, the which this the 30% of their electricity, also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the the wind; for this reason, their emissions of co2 and the price of their electricity are, respectively, a 65% and a 50% more high that the average european.
for the contrary, thank to the have of our policy energy, our neighbours a bill of electricity a 40% higher to the of the who french.
while that in a economy restructurings the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the peacekeeping of the usefulness industrial in the territory national, the companies french is benefit of the electricity more cheap of europe.
for that reason, any reduction significantly of the energy nuclear contribute a strong increase the price of the electricity, what that realism to the statements on the of our country and the defence of our power purchasing.
is is of a price that the great majority of the french is refuse to pay and, of fact, not opposition for principle to that kind of energy, according show the surveys.
remember that the policy energy of our country has lost build a sector industrial with jobs of work director and jobs.
widely looking to the export, ways a galaxy of specialist in the markets international and that can create jobs not.
if france leave the energy nuclear, contribute the of great part of these smes and the loss of the 6 million of eur year in exports french of equipment and services nuclear.
? what a designed for work sixty years, when is to the collapse of their manufacturer?
for as the equation of the energy nuclear, there that admit that not there a source miracle of production of electricity, the as that not there a source.
the development for part of of solutions with in emissions of co2, nuclear and renewable, shows the nature awareness of the sources of energy.
in the case of the energy nuclear, is essential keep the maximum level of security.
in france, we of a authority of security that has a control narrower and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction of.
our equipment, of recognised professionalism, are also obsessed for the security.
in a century, the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious.
so only one, the of, is in in a conditions operational normal; not resulted consequences not for the people not for the a environment.
in chernobyl, the accident is was the design the sink and to a failures human.
in, some people seem forget that the accident is was to two disasters natural of a reach, unprecedented, that wave the death of tens of thousands of people.
the sector nuclear of this accident, such as what was of the two previous.
thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security, and the operators and seating french and germans, the is a design capable of to such phenomena.
while what all the players afraid that want build a central, the interruption of their construction in would a great gift for the competitors of and, since that them nonetheless to free for in the leadership in the inevitable development the sector nuclear.
is essential and legitimate to the best options for our country, but would irresponsible to that the emotion, the undistorted and the refer a debate so important for the situation economic, social and financial of our country.
the immigration,? a burden or a opportunity for the economy?
the policy of immigration it for sarkozy has been that since various points of view: the of the services police, judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures, the doubts of this policy with the statute of&&; country of the rights human&&; of france.
more recently, is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the that has to the headlines, with the minister of internal( the newspaper the 23 of may) of last that france&&; not needs foreign, workers not&&;.
, however, rarely time is analysing since the point of view economic.
the question is that, on this issue, there quite consensus between the left and the right.
in the case of the right, jacques chirac the of in 1976 that&&; unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with close of two million of workers immigrants&&;, while that in the left, the besides what michel rocard that france&&; not can done office of all the misery the world&&; in 1990.
the only difference, the degree of generosity
in 2005, therefore the left as the right the fear to the invasion the territory national for a a of poles.
to both both, is as that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society french.
the only difference is in the degree of generosity with the that act with on to the immigrants.
in their programme, led is limited to include, those that the will as the&&; problem of the migration&&;.
this idea of the immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps is why, but economically its very face.
such as guarding the economists shoulder-to-shoulder and cameron in a labour recent that sums the knowledge more recent on the immigration(: world and it, may of 2011, university associated,.), there a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the flows migratory in the growth economic, the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
the- of the immigration apos the growth and it the employment.
the fears related with the impact of the immigrants is based in the idea of that these can replace to the workers national, in particular to the little would, pressing for that is reduce their wages.
but the experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are more well commission that substitutes of the workers national and who mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment.
the immigrants little would working in sectors that not by to workers national and the more would in sectors enjoy where the training not is the demand of personal.
a effect positive on the wages
the same way that a surgeon would difficulties for work in a country that have lack of, the between national and immigrants from that the arrival of these last 8.4 welcome in the wages and the employment of the national.
taking in account what previous, that a increase the 1% of the flows migratory is a increase of the wages real to long long-term of between a and a%.
and,, have in account the fact of that the diversity that the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and the growth economic( there a great proportion of awarding nobel americans and companies as google,,, and yahoo were considerable for immigrants).
the immigrants also are taxpayers contributors to the systems social, since that of average a 1% the budget total in the countries european.
the organisation international the work estimated, for example, that in germany a immigrant that it with a age of 30 years operators a contribution( income least expenditure) of eur to the budgets public of average for all their life.
the principle of their mandate, sarkozy wanted go to to the points of growth that you&&; with the european&&;.
these european, that to the immigrants, had exactly the effect reverse.
europe invented the democracy, only you lack think in a democracy european
the democracy is a well precious, but also fragile.
the continent european should power of this already that, although is invented in athens ago more of two billion years, to what long the century 20th has suffered the tragedies of the war world,, the holocaust, the roots, but also to very in spain, to days in portugal, the in greece.
some perhaps up that, for that the democracy definitely on their enemies, would enough exercise the vote and the way more direct possible.
we, since rostopchine&&; the small&&;, that is was of something thought.
the suffrage universal, although is is of a condition necessary for the democracy, not is enough for yes only and even can become in a&&; instrument of oppression&&;, as said themselves the.
not, the democracy required a more: a space public, a spirit public, values, a organisation, a separation and a control of the powers, a education, go, solidarity economic and social, justice.
the crisis that we in europe is a crisis economic, but is to point of become in a crisis policy and democratic.
the the referendum greek had, to this on, a double effect intend: was the need of a return take of the sphere policy, but also the worrying that of their alternatively, of their inconsistency.
must on this ambivalence for.
the truth is that the lines the with of the battle democratic currently is have and that, in many cases, the soldiers republicans already not making in the good sense.
not gaining if we a starting of referenda national, organised in role of the needs and of in.
a signing in white the european at or a high the we the hole:! what options for the citizen!
not, not we from old-fashioned of effect, but a exercise common, of plenary right, relaxed and we, of the options and the democracy, this time to at european.
not there crisis in greece, italy, spain, portugal( of fact, not where end the list), because only there a crisis, the crisis of europe.
the whole of europe is the that is to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of opinion, that the that suffering their powerlessness and their lack of solidarity.
is the whole of europe the that suffering a humiliation in the sphere international.
we actually for the transfer of sovereignty to europe, but is all europe the that lose slowly the sovereignty and, with she, every a of their nations.
what more urgent is that the sovereignty popular ’ the helm the project european.
because only together will the european reduce the weight of their debts, explained of the markets and preparation their future by the investment.
the exit of the crisis require decisions to at european that not will issue, a legitimacy democratic total, unless that be for the disaster.
after have fought for a time against this proposal of the socialists and of jacques delors, all the world for in the today a governance economic european.
that so be.
but think in she, a greater integration policy and democratic, and, that be as such for the citizens, would a new madness and we would to a new point died.
we in a new stage of the construction european.
for build the republic in france, was be&&; to&&; republicans.
the revolution motivated for interests not would enough.
this lesson still being applies.
we build a europe more integrated since the point of view economic.
only is will achieve build a europe more democratic in the level political, a real sovereignty popular european.
for build europe, us european.

the stream, new door of entry the gas russian in europe
the pipeline stream, that directly europe western with russia and for the fund the sea baltic, already is has since in service.
must supply gas for satisfy the needs of thirty million of who.
gazprom, the giant russian the gas, has wanted so the event with great.
the last tuesday, more of 500 invited, including four heads of state and of government, took to on the baltic, between the music of the and a delicate, in the opening the stream, the new pipeline that directly, under the sea, russia with germany.
symbolically, the chancellor german withdraw nomination, the president russian dmitri medvedev, the first minister french led and their counterpart of the countries netherlands, mark, have together the of the that controls the entry of gas russian in the network of europe western.
with this new pipeline, every year that million of metres cubic of gas russian additional to europe western to through of a first had of km that the region of st petersburg with the of.
a second should to end of 2012 that will supply a total of million of metres cubic of gas, is say, enough for cover all the consumption french.
also, already is about of the possibility of build a third for the same way.
for gazprom, the completion to time of this huge labour is aires of victory.
poland and the countries baltic is had therefore strongly the project.
of fact, the stream is to allow supply gas directly to germany, any the course earth for third countries( poland and ukraine).
of coup, these two countries some something of their power: for them, will more difficult influence in russia with the access to the markets of europe western.
in the point the debate, warsaw not in for the stream as a&&; new pact&&;, in reference to the alliance between hitler and stalin for should poland in.
is say, if the issue is politically delicate.
europe western, support the project russian, has obtained a greater security of supply.
but the price is a weakening of the europe of the energy, given that the project has led a gap between the european the this and the east.
russia has known, in so only five years, to their vision of a alliance direct between russia and the countries western rich, large consumers of gas and with a reserves every time more limited.
&&; this pipeline is a component of our partnership with russia, a new that we unite of in result&&;, this led for the opening the pipeline, proving to what point the large contracts the sector the gas are so political as economic.
all this it the broad greeted in the sides of the that of gazprom, many in, in the point of arrival the gas.
the construction of this pipeline also is a achievement technical.
the is made of steel of cement for against the of the ships.
is supports in the fund the sea, to a average of 200 m3 of depth.
for, was necessary avoid camps of mines that dating of the second war world.
&&; was necessary with or destroy a of them, for caution&&;, out, spokesman of the society stream.
also, was necessary possible the measures of protection of the, and the flora.
the is a long word of metal that is as 242 and not is interrupted in all their length: not for, not for stations of peacekeeping.
was measures a platform of control in the waters of sweden, but the responsible the project to the same the see that the swedish not were very prepared to allow that a society state russian is of in permanent in the sea with to their as.
&&; in case of, the step the gas in least of a minute&&;, precise.
in case of flight, the gas the pipeline is, for therefore, to the atmosphere.
but the seating they little likely that is would a flight, since that have to that, according the forecasts, will a flight every precursor years.
the control the state the pipeline is does by a control, for a per, that for inspections foreign, so as by a has that everything for the internal the pipeline.
with the in of a pure, is introduces in the internal the, that has a diameter of a metre, and is all with the gas.
to their arrival, after three hours minutes of journey to a at of three metres for second, except data precise on possible the metal.
the pipeline has been designed for work for fifty years, need of no kind of.
the movement the gas is does simply for the pressure.
the principle is of 200 and, to the exit of 100.
five companies have uk their forces for power to to out this project.
the company leader is gazprom, that has the 51% of the comes.
to she, is the german and(% every a), so as the noticed and the group french( 9% every one).
these five societies have created a company common, so-called stream, committed of build and exploiting the pipeline.
has their headquarters in, switzerland, where the taxation is especially favourable.
after, gazprom to this society, for a long-term of twenty-five years renewable, the whole of the capacities of transport of gas.
&&; to gazprom you in for the capacity total, regardless of the amount of gas that really is transport&&;, precise.
the funding of the construction the pipeline is has taken i in a 30% with the contribution of the and in a 70% by loans banking.
the cost total of the labour should achieve million of eur for the two.
for, for example, the investment has reached the million.
but the stronger are insurance of that not their investment, since that gazprom helping for yes only the risk of the expenditure.
the pipeline the baltic in, in a at of.
a, with 4.5 metres of at, are the door of exit the gas.
there a sensors that the pressure, the temperature and the characteristics specific the gas to the arrival, before of that is owed to the pipelines germans.
since the last tuesday, the terminal a a million of metres cubic of gas russian every time.
to total capacity, will three million for time and in 2012, six million.
