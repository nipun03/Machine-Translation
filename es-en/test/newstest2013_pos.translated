a strategy republican for – the re-election of obama
the leaders in its policy for the need of fight against the fraud electoral.
now well, the centre as this last a myth and says that the fraud electoral is least in the states united that the number of people that dying to cause of the fall of a like.
of fact, the lawyers armagh not have found of which 300 cases of fraud electoral in the states united in ten years.
a thing is certain: be new provisions fail makes to the rate of participation.
in that sense, these measures in part the system democratic american.
the contrary of what which is in canada, the states americans are responsible of the organisation of the elections federal in the states united.
and in this same line a majority of the governments we, to from of 2009, new laws which affected the process of have or of vote.
this phenomenon. has widespread after the elections of november of 2010, that crash the increase of new representatives in 26 1966.
in a, for the year 2011. introduced u-turn projects of law that the president-in-office the law of vote in 41 states.
the new laws election for which the electorate line a document of identity with a photograph, well of a test of citizenship.
for other furthermore, laws the periods of vote which, the right to as shape in the day the papers and turn its right the vote to the citizens with background criminal.
before of the elections of 2006, any state american requirements that the in a document of identity with photograph.
the state of was the first in demand.
the court supreme of the states united this in 2008 the being of the law of.
for this, the authorities is to ’ that to other states.
in the last years these authorities have projects of law in 34 states for force to the in to it a document of identity with photograph.
is important have in account that, the contrary of what that is in chirac, the citizens we not do of a document of identity universal, as the application of the security social.
of fact, a 11% of the citizens americans, is say, 21 million of people in age of vote, not they with any document of identity with photograph we for a agency government of their state.
for other hand, million of new electorate in 2012 are of a document of identity with these,.
but, to often, the obtaining the document of identity quickly costs more of one dollars.
with what which, the new restrictions concern of way socrates to the young, the minorities and the people with income netherlands.
in effect, a 25% of, a 15% of people that return than of 35 dollars the year, a 18% of the citizens of more of 65 years and a 20% of the electorate of between 18 and 29 years not they with a document of identity with photograph.
and still there more.
in many states the students, the electorate the more vote to the candidates democrats, not can used the document of identity with photograph we for its institution.
for other furthermore, these themselves states to the member of the difficult of fisheries or of which that brutal to the parties to use the documents by for these difficult.
before of 2004 no state the test of citizenship for vote.
had was the first state in it this by.
since 2011, a dozen of states has laws that are that the in which are citizens-.
these measures for, clearly, limit the vote.
it be which two of every three in support the party democrat.
for other hand, the legislators in 2011 certain laws the the have of the same day the papers in eight states.
also, constrained the right of the people and the groups to create a service of aid to the in which enrol.
these restrictions consequences.
for example, in the elections general of 2004, the by of have of the electorate the registration of around of 10 million of citizens.
the measures since 2009 reformation that the rate of have of new electorate much in 2010 in compared with the year 2006.
also, the legislators laws in other five states that bill the reduction the period of vote for advance.
for example, in the elections of 2008 in florida, a 33% of the electorate the apos for advance were, while the these they not accounted more that a 13% of the electorate the state.
in the case of the exactly what same.
these not for more that a 11% of the electorate, the that is to a 24% of the citizens that responsibility for advance.
, however, the are, which for a 76% the electorate, not for more that the 46% of the citizens that responsibility for advance.
for course, the legislators democrats and their supporters in have to the adoption of laws that the registration of electorate.
in this sense, the governors democrats have blocked several projects of law.
the ministry tax of the states united intervened for suspending the laws more.
. could, in part, limit the damage.
for example, so only 16 of 34 states were the law that requirements the presentation of a document of identity with photograph.
, however, is undeniable that the new rules if the exercise the right to vote in 2012.
the critical democrats which the hand partisan of the laws that is have voted, it the is clear that with them is is influence in the results of 2012 in the states key.
a report the centre of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted useable laws for suspended of the talking votes additional in the polling electoral for achieve the presidency.
is too it for that with certainty if these amendments to at of system electoral will a impact significant in the results of the elections presidential of 2012.
a thing is certain: be new provisions fail makes to the rate of participation.
in this sense, the measures in part the system democratic american.
speakers the cancer of prostate:? done the test or not one?
in effect, the test of is, in on, results definite, with counterfeit results negative or even counterfeit results positive, are the which. age to speeches so.
is a reason more that enough for to emphasise to the men, already of by itself, on if should done or not the tests of speakers.
? done the test or not?
we asked council to two.
in the studies by in the states united. was a a are of between the groups of shows, by what that is difficult read these data and to recommendations we.
for its part, the study european was certain difference of mortality between the patients the is had on the speakers and the which not.
the study, with a up to the 12 years, this also that there between to 30 and the 40% of for of infirm assessment if not. has cost-benefit the test of speakers.
i, for therefore, the test to from of the 50 years, or to from of the 40 years if your father has cancer of prostate.
the men of origin have a rate of risk more high.
the key is take a good decision a time affected the cancer.
there cancers and other cancers the are.
is truly necessary achieve that the patient understood the degree of risk of their cancer. is you must to all the options possible and not necessarily to the of prostate that not citizen-friendly against the life to long long-term, in whose case. must marking more well for a surveillance active of the disease.
today in day many men to the that. they has affected a cancer not are treaties, since that said cancer not is not publicly a risk for its life.
in its place, they we a surveillance active of the disease and, if this onus, they we a treatment.
every time with more regularly criteria government for decide who should or not be treaty.
i that is do the test in any case.
but is important that, with its doctor for it if must done the test or not.
has created, in cooperation with the society international of, a tool that be assess the pros and the cons the test of psa.

prevent the disease
unfortunately, not there a recipe miracle for prevent the cancer.
to despite of the progress of the research, the adoption of worldwide of life healthy still with the best way of reducing the risks of which the disease.
believe that if all the world well and. certainly what enough, is could prevent a 30% of the cancers.
&&; if nobody smoke, that rate., the least, the 50%&&;, confederation genève, for of the society canadian against the cancer.
in change, that around of 10% of the cancers are inherited.
many other still with completely gross.
for the society canadian against the cancer, the fight against the smoking still remains a priority to despite of the in the number of smokers.
the tobacco is for with the 85% of the cases the cancer of lung.
is, also, a factor of risk for other types of cancers.
which the health of the people.
&&; apos were today, still 1.5 million of smokers in chirac&&;, declared the spokesman genève.
a fact hopeful: 10 years after of stop of smoking, the risk of die of cancer is reduces to the half.

while the in one of them is error a on of the risks of cancer of prostate, in another what that is observed was, more well, a increase.
the effect of the included in the cancer not. has been it with clear.
for other furthermore, mr to in the importance of it on the concerns and the for family of every one with its doctor.
&&; the test of detection not from cancer.&&;
the of in detail
the announcement the likely discovery the of a great shock the summer last, and with reason.
is you, in effect, which this is involve the mechanism responsible of the mass of all what that there in the universe, nothing more and nothing least.
and what that is more, is is of the whose existence the model standard: our better or&&; least least& quot; statement of the nature and the are of the on, that yet not has been seen financially.
but for the not is completely clear that is, of.
we without no to certainly that there a new and that is seems a the of 20 for the model standard.
also, new data this week in a important congress of together fact in kyoto seem confirm that itself what is, although still behind more data for be completely in.
of all ways, we that. is of, it the the possibilities of you seem few. of what is is.
there, in this great world, a law not and absolutely that means that two innovia not can those in the same instead to same time.
not there way of broad this rule and not what best too, because will suppressing damage.
although the together of the particles or a world very complex, is has shown that also in she there a law of these,: the principle of exclusion of, which stipulates that two deposited not can take the same space the same time if are in the same&&; 2021& quot;;&&; 2021&&; be consists, unity way, of some of their,.
the classify the in two categories.
for a part we are with the good citizens naked, that supporting the principle of.
and for another are the, a of which not has respect for nothing, or the at not for this principle, the that means that can those in the same instead and to same time.
according the web the of the that, for true, is extraordinary, the is into in two groups: the hand, of the which not we here, and&&; of force&&;, by the that the large forces of the nature is and with the which the of request of any in.
these, was should here, not are the that we believe.
of fact, if is read this risk, is thanks to a trivial: the or the&&; of light&&; be as&&;&&; by the force radiation.
in effect, when a with a burden electricity accelerates or do of direction,&&;&&; the in that be environment; a little as when valuable a stone to a hole.
in this&&; i&&; a wavelength radiation( of the light, of the rays, of the rays, etc.), and this not is another thing that a; is say, one of the&&; spread of force&&;.
field more stable
happens what same with the of, with the than of that is is of another field, the field of, that needs be&&;&&; the which this solutions.
now well, the field of is simply more stable that the field. for ago is, to concentrate extremely higher, a little as if is like of a hole sobering in the which so only a rock could would for the ground.
for this ago is a vast fell of particle as the of the( even the great of is a ring of 27 km of!) for achieve such levels of energy.
the with the field is a new tool that is the relationship between the and the mass.
of fact, not all the not all the materials with the field.
some, as the eradicate, the do, but other not: a piece of role, by example, not. will never for itself same politician to the door of a begin.
and of the same way, not all the living with the field of: the that the do have a mass, while that the rest( how the, were true), not the have.
now well,? what&&; strike to&&; research?, question the madam.
for the science, this serves for verify the validity the model standard(), and be, also, which the the differences between the comments and the predictions the.
for its part, many want strong that is they, because the have difference could open a door to a&&; new& quot; which certain the model.
this, there that it, has still enormous, as that not proposes that on to the is(!!) or to the issue are, which constitutes around of 80% of the on the universe(! one!).
but not we found such differences in the to the at.
impact
the impact of whether research in our day to day are difficult of predict, but not we that we be the say that not will no.
for which need: to at of the years 60, excessive pioneers the infrared in the not in all the revolution that their jobs.
the applications, but nothing more.
of fact, as already said the, which worked in the laboratories, where is the in 1960, and the- the prime we( the first were) in 1962, has principle the was more well as a&&; of laboratory&&;.
...
and also, the applications can also to of of the wider that home to the research.
for example, the same contractors a of light in 1969 in the course of their research in on of.
to despite of that not was in no their intention original, serves now of&&; demands&&; the no the digital the world, the that you the nobel of together in 2009.
that not to say, for course, which the activities the want necessarily into our lives, but that never. know ...

every one for all.
before of that shock in spain, not had and a at have in all my career.
with, pay and sell, banks
all what contrary to the trade monetary current, based in the banks central, the transactions and the burdens of thus between the parties.
also, as to often are in the technologies, the vision policy is talking: the conviction of that the system monetary current, up of banking, for to the crisis financial.
of fact,, invented for( a), is to the time a currency virtual manchester to dollars, eur, etc. and a protocol of change insurance to the way of, which be the exchange of file of equals to as.

the share the, after have seemed to the now of 30 dollars( 23 eur) in june of 2011, to 2 dollars five months most later, before of again to risky the ten dollars( the contributions is in the website).
not is nothing if what compared with the changes world in real or in products financial.
, however, the bank central european( ecb). for he in a report on the categories in october.

some of them are very expressed to the muslim muslims.
as expected wait, the articles what have been for it.
to the them years grace, for another part, the fact of that a of the few differently of the working is has expressed practically to the in of the ungrammatical, and is this that several states the committee who to think that the clock of the was wrong.
the text, which yesterday later was still remains voted, consists of 234 articles.

for now there is nobody to here if will or not this to the nine points, or if has that lose forces and in their early stages.
the actions of protest they with the support of the trade and of a number of ngos of left.
also the increase of the wages for the workers of and the the system of food quick, the aim of the apos of the protests is the creation of& of workers in these companies.
for now, this sector of the economy virtually not has been supported for the movement trade.
? on and six cents the year?
the actions lawyer the week last, after the day of action of thanks, the so-called&&; friday popular&&;. that day, in states united the orgy of that to million of inhabitants, and that to sometimes rugova intends of clashes.
that day, some workers of the, which to 2.2 million of people in the world, their jobs of working and guards of protest together to the unions and activists of left in the shops of the might, whose products in to people of income modest and.
sells of all, since, control of apos and batteries for cars, to, eggs and milk.
the products in their shops are of average between a 8% and a 27% more cheaper which the of the supermarkets more large.
is for that that many workers in paid of buy only in the work.
the prerequisites and the had of products have fact of a of the corporations more would of.
according the words two critical, can the to of terms products to very under price, in part because they one to their workers.
these they also is complain of the bad conditions working, such as the lack of or of hand.
that&&; friday popular&&; the participants of the demonstration the increase of wages and is of that the cost the sure of health for the happened of 30 to 100 dollars between.
for a worker typical of, which it dollars for hour, this expenditure is excessive, said.
scientists of the university of capitalists in unlinked that if is the wage a discovered 12 for time, this you cost to the might 3.2 billion of dollars.
this is approximately a 1.1% more of what that on in wages now.
if position the just wage in the on of the consumers, every visit to the shop they find only 46 cents more expensive.
in a year they will the 234 amount of dollars more of what that are now.
the supporters of turkish satisfied that the protest had place so only in nine states and that not horrible no to the might.

the protest continued this week in new york, in the that the objectives not were the large stocks( which in this city not them prevalent, and by that for now not there nothing), but the&&;&&;-&&; and restaurants.
! labels&&; says that sells thousands of millions of place, and been not even you the low for and not you for your work an!
pear, member the council he of new york
currently, of agree with the law federal and the of new york, the wage minimum is of for time.
the restaurants of food rapid what will increasing with the time, but only slightly, and of average, the workers they in new york dollars for hour.
nobody earns least the they in this city.
how is possible survive in new york with that money, for me is something incomprehensible.
there a time when almost the quarter part of the adolescents americans become for the s&&;- and they there, behind of the appropriate, to time part-session after of the school, although still living with their parents.
few were the which basis this as the main source of income or stay there a time.
now, constantly in some interviews with workers of s&&;- which is complain of that have that life of this wage, and to sometimes even them to their children.
for other hand, in a forum of the magazine street street wall there a, whose author out that is irresponsible have children if not no with what i of eat.
the participants in the protests, that started to the 6: 30 of the morning the thursday in the labels&&;- of the street and, demanded that to the and of food rapid is they to pay for after 15 for time, or be, which. they its wage minimum current.
also demanded that in the sector of the food rapid is believe unions of workers.
the law of the us. by to the administration this law and be to the the movement trade with and redundancies.
for other furthermore, time the administration they across the life.
but, for reasons objective, is easy that the unions the sector of food.
one of the main is the excessive feel the personal.

protests together there that same day in other restaurants over of manhattan.
the completion of the action had no to the rally in the labels&&;- close of times mercifully, in the that took several political christian local, in particular the member the council he of the city pear, which said:&&;&&; says that is sold thousands of millions of place, and been not even you it a hospital or you they for your work an&&;.
the demonstrators the support of other led of new york, for example the serve to mayor of the city bill of, that said that&&; must to the workers the sector of food quick for that receiving wages and the prosperity economic that is deserves every&&;.
as what described the terribly new york times, this has been the largest demonstration of this such in the history of the food quick.
but in she took only a few hundreds of people, even not all they were who the service of food quick, in the that tens of thousands of people of new york.
still not is clear if this will of for to a movement massive.
&&;& now, is the brain not is so easy&&;
the issue of the reality, so popular between the to the technologies modern, recently is is with it mainly to through the prism of mrs special.
to the summer, in their conference annual google this a model in movement and subsequently, in november, is it that had have also a request for all the on patent.
, however, of a conversation with the head the group of technology at in the of microsoft of cambridge,, is that for the scientists of that company, the glasses already to a stage last.
to they them appealing the prospect of the manipulation of objects categories in the air with the just, and the creation of this categories open.
- for favour, in terms general,? what is the this of can of their group of research?
- seen a to the goes, but also we of one the limits of this interaction.
for now the in its great mass has been imprisoned in the stage of working with the of the screen flat, to sometimes the true with the finger.
but we want years forward and the changes winds in this interaction.
for example, the these and the toad represent a step forward and today in day any. sells,, it the to all they is on control by made.
-? what more we of the future?
- to despite of that has taken the goes the level physical, a part of this still are in a screen flat, to sometimes in at.
the introduction of information has just( the system it data), and the still not is very good.
we trying of change this, work in systems of nigh truly, based in different, including the of design.
. must need the world of the which to our, to physical, do more tangible.
for this,, however, is involved recognise not only the support, but also the space that what are.
then we complete the world real with of a way more comfortable.
in first place,- has with these his of reality virtual!
-? what do you on on control by voice?
a detail very popular, but? not believes that what?
- clear that not. to can be a panacea, there outstanding of resolve the question of privacy, it the not always. to which the others is mr of our actions and intentions.
of fact, all the types of interaction with colleges are good, but every one in its own field.
for example, for the control of conducted in places public, a project in the which we in the s, but not in movements loose, but more shorter.
also, the s were not for the probable the framework, but for a is that, the movement of the bones and the truly.
for now is very large, but in theory can be small the size of a clock of is.
but, in general, the future is for a the combined of control, for example of voice.
-? how is that?
- for example,? i you which you ask this ship of?
you speak and the the same time.
- i only i.
-, this is to be very difficult of recognise.
-? or durban, you to to the users to adapt to what that can or not can to in this at the machine?
- not necessarily, but is a rapprochement mutual.
i that in a future next we to have that work mainly in the design of new types of developing that they establishing with to the reactions of the person.
these can be, for example,, it the institution a good resolution in depth, the that is very important.
- if we of their work with the of,? why lack has you of the cameras modern?
? them lack resolution, depth or something more?
- in principle, the generation current is what that can be the start of our work with the.
for course, would good obtain 8 to the speed of 1.
but the issue not is in the, but in the quality of the will and in the depth.
since this last point of view, all the technologies current not are what enough good for do; this more to the i of.
or be, which we that remind not only the this in the indeed menacing and and, but also in.
also is important the at, the number of vaults by secondly.
the movements human are quite active and the current of 30 are truly scarce, on all for the s.
, of our laboratory in, was a bonnet of contact with of thus of 1 to 100 and is mention that the you toad in number are more close the secondly value().
not all the world understand in what measure this affects to the goes.
to me i would very useful for my work a on of, framework, but that not take contact for that the we for second are more.
-? and not is an the number of chambers?
- the has now three&&;&&;, a of the which is of fact the of could lasers and the second the recipient of the sign has.
but the third house is in reality a that bonnet the visible.
this not is used for it the depth the this.
potentially, more amount of chambers could solve the problem ...
or the contrary, hoped and fundamental the amount required of are.
would good create a flexible apos, to with the of location of the cameras and do how this help to the.
- for what that i remember,, to difference of google, not has submitted their glasses the public.
? not you seems that, since the point of view the use on of technologies of reality, the glasses are one of the platforms more we?
- for course, reimbursed all the quot sustainable in high a telephone intelligent in the hands, not is very comfortable, but i i: the best option would a reality&&;&&; when, in basis of a platform of horde, you could to of the mrs to telephone intelligent,
the are equipment very personal, in that is their force( the things private only you will them), but also its weakness: a reality based in glasses not you will work on online and with others people.
- for a at that the manipulation of objects categories in the air is available not only for tony of the film&&;&&;, but also for any that fatal.
there a problem in this idea that the critical brutal out:! not there answer!
! the just not feel nothing!
? what answers their group for this challenge?
- in my impress to often say that the is the seventh cathedral in the interaction between the man and the machine.
i that the capacity well could be the addition of.
while meanwhile, one of the noticed more interesting is the use of the second hand in quality of session for the image.
! petrol the me perfectly!
but there also technologies that are truly to to to these&&; pictures in the air&&;. for example, the interference of several could community-driven to a point specific where. is the finger it one been similar to the that one you if someone if in the of the it, but that been still is very weak.
there also for the wrist that leave in the of the it, this also a direction promising.
-? has treaty of kid the brain?
? to think that he you what that seems that should across in the time in that is something?
- that is a good idea, yet not the we tried.
here. behind one challenge with the that we that fight for a time, how to that a person physically wish in a space very small creates that will to a space open, almost, end. are working also in the idea of the of can( not as the of the drugs), platforms mobile, as as the of the giants.
for now, is the brain not is so easy, still there that work for many years.
that is what that ago must the work with the virtual for the researchers, that a things is are in a state of total view.
personal somewhat in instead of culture-
&&;&&; continue the project&&; of san petersburg&&;, in to the citizens that. are,, to the forefront the resale and of the culture.
in this list of the best in are we the art and the scene of san petersburg, whose achievements they more beyond of the city: to often are recognition in europe, that russia the man even.
the new hero of&&;&&; is the artist miller.
all the city to miller, a man clothing of red of it from, the that. can find close the museum russian, are the garden of summer or in meetings of fashionable and.
the we of always to, where wants that is appropriate.
miller is one of these incidentally of san petersburg, floor of new.
miller is a brilliant representative the of the petersburg of end of the 80- at of the 90.
also, is a man urban, whose in the streets of the city meeting in the inhabitants and to all the state of on.
recently, took in their hands a and. became in the of san petersburg, it the has grown for to so difficult role, for its these bohemia, their philosophy and its image.
-,? do what mary for the city clothing of red and not of or, for example?
- the colour, because am leather of fashionable and i am to the and to the image.
in this world, the colour, is a compromise between the artist, the are of pictures and the.
although in the society, all what that not be a in grey for degree and extremely of health nothing good.
but my simplified are, to that. be a conversation.
all the history of my actions are a invitation the debate.
-? when that be artist?
- in a exhibition the palacio of culture, where is ones my jobs.
i realised account of that that was my way.
then the wave of members not official, and the new, free as i, were still.
i way friend of artists of the new you, with the topics to the that. in gaza and, that organization to&&;&&;, and already is more the new you.
i in the acting for the clothes, the music of all the mixing, but not for the you.
- and all this is in your clinic of art ...- for me was important in the centre cultural of san petersburg, where is orleans the best minds less.
in 1995, a territory in and there, allowed not had reforms, took a club musical, a club karlsbad, the house of the bohemia of san petersburg.
many born there:, about, i the are in that by the to&&; the eartag of will&&;.
and their friends songs under, short, between they was the currently composer of fashionable borys.
when the group play to an in in, is became in&&;&&;.
was of many programmes before of the times of.
them given to and was the start of their great career; the education when and training the daughter of us.
&&; provisions&&;, the&&; club, are, remains of the leonard the art.
there would our who and customers.
am a hero the century last, when the culture mean something.
in the year 2000, the survey is in the press, the pressuring was&&; the people of our city&&;.
in the nomination&&; of year&&; i, and shorter my completion.
in these new times not is comfortable work; i am a man the that you do the true, the honesty and the culture the century last.
in our times is easy done popular, but the culture and the popular will here. one can be popular but very little one.
- there in your jobs something recognisable.
- many of my are, in them is differently clearly the today and the from.
i to to a exhibition agenda,&&; the russian in buffoons&&;.
the are a speech.
i before or, but now be this is painful and extremely.
but in the buffoons all. and the tragedy is uen.
i delighted the grotesque, have ideas grotesque.
for example, the for the world by a change totalitarian and compulsory of clothes.
i to one what still for the clothes, in what external, but not in the within of the person.
and,, time to that person not. to should not to the hand, but in the face.
and the is when is changes of clothes.
- ago little you saw in the role of urban.- a city must have a hero this.
! who better that i for for!
- well but,? to the better the trade can be cooks?
- now the trade must be careful, fresh, have me.
are witnessing witnessing of the disintegration of the cultures.
before the people is in, the a thing, the others.
now all is have divided in, is difficult please to all.
not am a tickets of one dollars for to all.
now be which think to who once.
now, every hero of religious has their 100 nowadays.
-! and for to they for thousands!
- will to it the, there works the.
and to a annual cultural will 300 people, 10 thousand never come. as result, than management, than money, all..
i to my nowadays, the more important is not deceive, not to to lose what that,.
when was young was such which a the your in the back the on of and.
i i with, with the the for the general the people stops.
i to often exclusively the we.
say culture spiritual, culture of consumption.
not there no culture in the consumption, that is another history.
i am a man of the culture of yesterday, under the example of artists which living in the poverty and in the poverty, is the money only for paint we.
i am to favour of this culture.
-,? why is what that you what to the petersburg?
- good experts in culture.
there a concept: official of the culture.
but not all reliant can on to the culture.
when the get were the right all was of other way, the get such time not seaports they will the culture, but they that was necessary keep to the experts right.
in moscow now be very good consultants.
we in the petersburg that well could be experts, but are schools, because. need experts to a level higher that have to flat and them checkpoints way.
now is the they personal somewhat.
what same, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all the resale modern is accepted, there some which have that to other enjoyed.
-? what is for you the petersburg?
- they not is a capital cultural. in moscow there very more culture, there there ground.
but on our mixed is difficult that the art s.
we current cultural and we now more support which, this is wrong.
in europe there a lot of people with curious that will to and concerts.
in our case, this class is tiny.
we that to that the resale is of fashionable, as what was to at the century last.
the project. with a subsidy of the petersburg.

for be the mankind is ago the question main:? how continue the is in of or in the same planet of parts?
i that there little where choose.
of fact, only two are real which can be, the least.

the last time that a&&;&&; to the deploy was ago 16 years.
in the spring the 2013 the experiments.
, however, in the&&;&&; sink species of a same sex.
there a experiment with rats, that were the space already with.
in principle, not. did nothing.
&&; this egyptian precisely in the, but this was a experiment single, and studies as this must be to out&&;,.
after the implications, the rats their.
, however, yet not is has we address the problem of the reproductive directly in the space.
is a challenge difficult.
the animals, the lose its habitat her, merely not can to its your sexual.
the man,, however, to difference of the small animals, in principle, can.
the has the odd abstract and is able of create a fund emotional for.
experiments similar not. are to out for reasons ethical.
but the women jari the space since ago victor 50 years.
the greater risk what happened.
and what more precious that has the humanity is the that female.
our flying, and no in the earth could say: if is after of a flight the space.

in june of 1964, only after of a year the flight to space, the first woman,, to light to a daughter.
the father of the her,, was also.
in 1988, the second women, zavadskaya, who two sometimes rugova in deploy and even worked in the space open, difficulty a son.
, however, the risk still.
are few, are writing the to punish after of that flights all them safeguard result well, and a generation healthy next growing.
&&; and if is can say more, is dangerous even in flights&&;, reaffirm the pilot, of the union soviet, hero of russia,.
, however, the mankind must to some new ways in the biotechnology, in the protection radiation, in the creation of the how artificial.
the the centre of preparation of is a stage are in the preparation for the flight.

if for a adult the water is a environment comfortable, although still hostile, for a child newly old is its element home.
the small seem confirm that the life in the earth the with.
there a connection between the fact of that the is may lost 9 months within of their mother in the tanks, because it will more easy used then the water.
in principle, this is are, because since the at the birth to the at the first it are only 2 weeks.

in short, if the out is a state more natural for a newly old, for the women is that the, the force of the how.
in the the truly and of the is very quickly, the ability of expulsion the;. reduces.

head of: the the system&&;&&; not has given with the political guilty
in on of tenders public, the republic czech account with good breadth and a legislation of quality, although its implementation.
this what says, vice-president of the office of control particular() in a interview for.
&&; the law never will perfect&&;, but their implementation be be right.&&; this is, in my opinion, the that we lack&&;, as describes the situation current.
the controls of the inspectors and germans also who to conclusions similar.
as example of a practice wrong, refers the attitude of to the system of be be only on the role, which is known as the system&&;&&;.
the first minister said recently that the ods( party democratic along) not to the entrepreneurs with inspectors. then,? is doing or allowed?
&&; the law must be campaigns of some are and whether banning something, in that case, not the president the government can prevent the apos of the office that has the obligation of make these controls that obligations&&;,.
in the meeting of the commission of control in the congress of the members,. about the project common between the team czech and the german, in the framework the which. edgar the legislation corrective to the contracts public in two countries.
? what is exactly?
is is of a control parallel that it to rush ago a two years.
said of way it: the legislation european how. must organize the contracts public, to this you still the legislation to in every country and, after, the for in itself.
we it we uk all and, although the control yet not has complete, we vote differences very interesting. generally, the legislation of our country is&&; more and more full&&;,, however, the for concrete in some is best in germany.
. confirms, because, that not enough with provide rules every time more up, but that is necessary focus in the implementation of the law same.
? what can to of fact this project?? what believes which are the conclusions?
they a control common of this the could taxes to which we of she efforts in the closer of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, although this not has a impact so positive.
the economy the savings means to a thing proper to a price reasonable( the that not always which the price be the more under) for avoid this the and, to the long, the actions criminal.
but not for the fact of reducing the limit of the contracts to that which take to this.
perhaps because the system is read with therefore&&; tape&&;, that those which want to going in the system will do more easily that if the limits is maintained so they as now.
. about of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the of the contracts public.
? how works the system of controls in germany?
? is a office to our or is at of other way?
in to the offices, as the, there it the( court federal of auditors), with a organisation similar to the our, with a school also, the only is that in its case is home of a are a therefore different, but in principle both parallel.
also the powers are to true point,, however, in therefore that germany has a organisation federal, the courts of auditors in are even to this level. in this is children slightly of our system.
the court federal of we() only can control the money federal, the that here wondering funds state.
the funds public, which are administered for the regions and the municipalities, there, in germany, is are in the court federal of auditors.
in as to the legislation local,? is more simple that the our?
for what general, not i like of a compared, data specific. not however, germany still remains a model in some aspects, but not. can must with what in what is better.
? could be better, for example, in on to the quality of the inspectors?
that sure that not, but, repeat, not i like to this kind of comparisons.
is necessary say that even those countries which we as behind must to with to a great number of problems.
if not would this, not them contribute no benefit work with our office, we not you?
in as to the legislation of our country,? why for its me the amendment of law on the contracts??. to of some are their which?
taking in of that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, yet not is has said in the actions of control.
given that controls regarding post, is to with a true delay.
for now, is it in the process of preparation of the controls future: we on a new tool of&&; of risks not economic&&;, by the that we fact to almost 14 contracts, which have been. the changes in be perfectly about here, it the is modify the limits, is the conditions of some tax the process of selection and similar.
? as that the discharge of this law is or that, more well, is a patchwork for the system bureaucratic?
i that this law is surely a step in the direction right and hope that this be.
the problem that can that is that the regulation&&; be& quot; and the be impossible you.
already with the regulation previous, the people were linked the contractor( for example, in the case of the programmes operational regional the council regional), and every law not respected in on of tenders public the violation of the discipline budgetary.
? has sense then the law of this way?
i that not of this way.
the system must they to those that themselves or from of he and not be to those that stated a fault formal, which not has which in the decision-making of decisions.
a system of this the only will create a greater pressure bureaucratic.
? and how is its of this?
due of where we for this way on.
the first minister has of recently that the not to the entrepreneurs with controls the for system, with reference the fact of be be only on the role. quot what means this?
? the system&&; is or allowed?
the law must be activity of some are and, if banning something, then not even the first minister the government can prevent the apos of the office that has the obligation of make these controls and obligations.
can say:&&; the programmed and what we&&;, but not can say that do as if nothing.
in the law on the contracts public, the regulation is are be in as the way in that. must act formally. and and is as must be for protect the competition public.
but, by another on, is tragic that is excluded to candidate with the best in for not to the sweden formal.
the law never will perfect, but its implementation must be right. this is, in my opinion, the that we is.
the roads have numberplates of ice, although in its most are provide
in several places of the republic czech the roads have numberplates of ice and of snow.
although the most of the the are provide, in some be the.

the the, together with other interpreters, also hymn the called anthem against the end the world, which been for title&&; the world, cancelled&&;.
currently is popular in youtube,? is will hear in the concerts make?

to for the centre educational, barriers, which our to term in its sixth year running with the civil in.
the just of the school of regularly the visit of; the which out activities and interesting.
the a not do of media economic enough for, to the teachers and we a for do possible.
in the framework of the completion of the works in, censuses a building independent the that we with this project.
in every of type several groups and interpreters.
? what are the criteria of a?
possible european a programme that be must for all the generations, including the children.
for example, in prague,, with they, the, and paroubek.
for obtain information more detailed, from.
? you, a&&; action witnessed&&; similar in the future?
in may by first time in the, and that here surely preparing a programme must with guests interesting.
the year that next also we would an in the national trouble of new york and to me, personally, important that we in states united, i like with actions in washington and in convinced.
plans in the abroad not are precisely, to now this for example in madrid, brussels, london or moscow.
the is, not however, a group up for people with disabilities.
? how is the- and the organisation of these travel?
not is so difficult how can appear to first at.
there five member in a of wheelchair electricity, the magnificent must travel in the operates for luggage and also for a weight, the boxes with the instruments ...
, however, to now we the have this well. and british major were 000 ready, thing that not is of amazing.
even in moscow, of where we have ago little, did all, problems.
thanks to the through the abroad quot for the different towards of the society s the about and other aspects.
? with what you you will to now?
in madrid, luxembourg, london and other cities, all parts better that here; in russia we been we of that, in the this, there a way for go.
to difference of prague, moscow is full of together, further still, be among that a person is properly one for the centre of the city in a a of wheelchair electricity.
something so aware as is, for example, to preference to someone in a of wheelchair in lift, there not the is.
for we, is has created a civil that. striving for the problems of the people with disabilities.
? in what aspects we example of countries more progressive?
there many aspects in the that we for behind ...
but is important mention that the and the improvement of the situation always on of the people to the that affects directly.
in london and in madrid is very normal that the people with a disabilities serious properly for its account in public and can go the service, the museum, where wants ...
but not is very common that a great number of people with disabilities why in the life social of a labour, in this is, with the- we a little for,!
a society environmentally-friendly or, barriers is a thing, but when when the at in the that emergence athletes, artists, players, political or lawyers, start to change all of truth.
to now, are cases isolated of people which have a great force of will.
the the is currently very popular, but if a years back,? why will he to be the group in 1998?
went as in, where had very people he to my around that deal to something.
and since that i am little,, between other, the, a group with a that of work.
and with the time, as says our, is we was a little of the hands( laughter).
, however, the popular not came to these last years,? or i wrong?
is true that we entire quite the fact of people with piglet and also work actively for a the group.
will to the conclusion of that the work that not. is, is as if not had.
thanks to the aid of the union european, we eye also teacher of quality,, etc.
? because intention of an so far with the?
since the principle i the potential that had, which. can to something of another way.
the world the entertainment is full of things that is seem the protect to the other.
is are, to its way, all what again is doping with caution and it a time in accepted.
there few things, but i terms to say that the is one of them.
the impression of someone that we is by first time is clearly the compassion, is one reaction natural ...
but the compassion is completely superfluous because the people with disabilities not are they that normally and of the which we have compassion.
there people that is able of life a life full and develop, with the condition, for course, of that of the media necessary.
i always say that if something they its well to people with disabilities, then, not is only a progress for they, but for all the society.
? entire the fact of that is. a head hard, as you describes very people?
if we on a work of quality, we that be we in many aspects and certain discipline.
i that is completely normal.
some people they with a vision romantic and with the head in the divorced and when. usually that have that two to, go to the test s and to a time acp and in concerts, the euphoria initial them.
but this is how works in all parties, in every group that to work and to something.
currently the the has twenty member.
? many of them were already in the beginning the year 1998?
only one:.
are a group open, the people will and its, not. can avoid.
who has will and always the doors open
will the day before the having end the world, the discussion to the 21 hours
will place in the bit of prague, in of and in in and 12 groups and other running of the republic czech
the three cities is the end of the spent to through of we for i together the song the the&&; the world, cancelled&&;
the aim of of is how the resources necessary for finance multi-functional the centre educational, barriers in of prague, 190 cost to 25 million of billion.
the entry the of costs 400 and the children to 12 years have shortly free in the option of sale accepting in
poland and the manage.
in the meeting of ministers of the countries of the agency space european in the week last is to poland as member of the this. is the secondly country member of the this the former home of europe the this, after of the republic czech, which is became in member point the 12 of november of 2008).
poland set a s collaboration with the this in the year 1994 and for the years participant in the commission of projects of the agency.
, however, the way of poland to the manage started a before.
the polish already is always to the flights the space before of the second war world, but not always with their work.
remember, for example, the conference of in the of warsaw in the that, the 6 of december of 1933, presented their ideas on the study hit&&; introduction to the drawing&&;.
the ideas the today engineering( the got) to the of harrowing and, years after, which the dr: had been the only that had shown interest in its work.
in the year well france the prize robert and louis burkhard for its&&; introduction to the drawing&&;.
the doctor:(- 1966), slightest before, is became more later in a great drive of the and of the drawing.
hundreds of goods in and& a number of books linked to this discipline scientific.
. became in a promoter of the drawing, was known in all the world and its contribution to the science. was rewarded when. it its name to one of the of the for fooled of the moon.
already in the year autonomy. was in poland a that going to be sanctioning of a engine of rockets.
unfortunately, is best who was the author of the proposal and channel is local the the project.
not is clear if on was to be used for the element of the or for its slowed.
the information on this. does to the seized in the press of the time.
to from the year 1933 the it polish began to on to the rockets.
the research was by for the in cooperation with the. and..
to the material essential, is ago clear that the research came the on of the trials practices.
not however, with the arrival of the troops german, is was the research.
in the year lituania recent in the press specialised the toxic of a of which by the engineering and the year next was published the study&&;- i&&;, the author.
both projects were the use military of the engines for rockets.
little before of the war, the committee advisory provisional() is control of all the projects of techniques of rockets for use military and all the jobs.
the committee was monasteries in lituania, but after of two years of activity, is was interrupted for the it of the war.
other studies from to the drawing this in the press polish after of the war thanks to working of the society polish of().
in the issue of november of 1954 of the magazine is ago reference for first first to the society with four articles very far-reaching devoted to the.
in one of them, the., is for the creation of a society that. devoted to the drawing.
in that time already is had since in march projects of realms artificial and was obvious that the research cosmic was a discipline with prospects of future.
since principles of 1956 the society polish of() increase to that part of the federation international of(- in 1951) and in autumn of that same year the is became in member point.
the year next the first president of the,(- 1959), changed to be the vice-president of the federation international of.
he this office to its death in 1959.
to from the 1956, the participated of way significantly in the development the probe(), which was a success and. became in the first had polish in the that is he to out research scientific.
the first was complete in 1957 and. for first time on 10 of october of 1958.
the had a on of are metres, a 80 regulation of which and not hardly to the 5 kilo of weight.
more later, is shorter of building the version and in summer of 1959. were the trials airlines of the rockets of two stages in the desert of.
the had 1.4 metres and a 11.5 kilo.
another kind of in development starve to be this of can scientific real. the was to have a on of km and their would control the it of up.
, however, in 1962. turning the jobs.
the successor of the first rockets the the was on, that. was for the years 1962 and 1965.
. as had of two stages, with a around total of and a of drafted of self-employed.
. too three types( naked, and), which is between itself for the space available for the scientists.
in the the space available for the volume was of 0.4 around, in the of around and in the of around.
the on of in the three types was of 37 km.
between the years 1965 and 1968. developed in the institute air on, whose early evidence airlines. were in october of 1970.
the had a of drafted of offers and was able of more a weight useful of 10 to 60 km of up.
subsequently is was the version and.
is necessary mention also the entry of poland in the( rate for part) in the year 1960 and the training the committee national of two years after.
in the framework the programme, poland. joined to the research the space on photo artificial and, in the year 1978, the pilot polish. became in the secondly after of vladimir remek.
the suspension of the law on jobs social not is the solution.
the week last the who constitutional suspended the law social.
the resolution a discussion in the society.
since then will interesting at the reflection maintained for a point of view more broader.
the systems economic liberals in the eu, as that in the world globalised, is based in the principle of a greater competition economic and least be.
in a, this means that the different that economic and the systems economic national are in conflict permanent between itself.
the cause. is in the principle the free trade and the movement free and unlimited of capital private, together with the speculation financial unbridled.
the effect of the large differences in the cost labour( of the wages) is tensions.
under this concept is necessary understand the situation in the that the manufacturer, with the import of goods cheap, to shorten distances and for this&&; a&&; quot the competitor with the aim of we with the greater part the market and, of this way, increase its for of benefits.
to great at means, for the most of the employers, enterprises the production the abroad, buy there more cheaper or well and. the result is a unemployment high in those countries in the which the price the work, in compared with other economies, is more high.
as to that the capital private not has decision-makers social a and, with this, not is responsible the unemployment that this phenomenon and, growth necessarily the expenditure social the state.
all this situation being the total reminded of the employers by pay taxes and possible the damages economic and social the have caused in their now of we benefits.
the situation is universally so known that not is an appear data monitoring specific.
the practices in the capital private think situations, in certain economies, in the that the governments of these countries in, forced to with the aim of reducing artificially the level social of the itself population and, of this way, to capital abroad the country.
said of other way, the governments are capital to available of their own population, have in account the decline social.
this. ago patent on all in the changes of the laws force.
the aim is intended to the population to which accept the partly the capital private, on all in what that as to the of.
this has place, for a part, by the system of obligation economic in the case of unemployment of long-term one;& on,, the law restricted of the employees in as to rights working.
the result is a poverty growing together with the increase of the differences between poor and rich.
since ago a number of years, there in germany views of over of food for people poor the not can is with its own work.
the number of people that they this kind of aid a already the million.
in the framework the as of the competitiveness of the economy german, is is a case quite among: people with a wage so under that the state must pay the rest for to the minimum essential for survive.
. was public a scandal of this the related with the situation of the employees junior the parliament federal german.
the measures of for of virtually all the states the southern of the eu group,,. to doubt, to the same situation. and people, for a decline of their level social, is, counting to migration as in the century 19th or to with a wage in the limit of the society, with the hope of that some day when the country capital investor private.
? is involved of where next?
in the case of that is, of other countries of the eu, then the depend is of a country to another or not a never, since that chinese, american,, turks, quot, for or are on for a tiny part of a wage european.
this also affects to all america latin.
the liberals and the media of communication quality to the all that the been not should capital to the economy, that you the economy exploitation to its failure.
the capital private it with will and nail the would of that the state not should intervene in the economy in the control.
to then, is involved ask if the capital private not with its enemies in the march policy and, for which, in all the state.
in this case the answer is clearly answer.
the test is the existence of lobbies, in the practice very in and curse, in all the states.
the result is a situation desperate that. to in the area of the corruption, in the lobbies, in a legislation that is virtually attitude in all parties not is emphasis.
in germany the situation is the next: the ministries state, to is of media financial, the significant of projects of law to companies legal private, the which are to often linked with the industry.
this kind of projects of law are adopted after in the bundestag, the parliament german.
of this way, all the power not from the people,, and as. opening in the constitutions of the democracies western, but of the strong groups financial that for their own interests.
is obvious that the democracies with a discriminated liberal. are in a situation how the that describes in its you the crisis of the republic seen in times of and:& for; the during and the administrations in to the force&&;.
to change of talk, and aid for funding stones or.
the bribery and the corruption. nets, from have and the people to the vote with the vote of advance&&; ...&&; not had they with nature that to a since in the administration, as that a time, to cause of this ourselves, the state was eight months without each&&; ...&&; to in seriously of that the only no for a situation so serious was the and that was necessary always a man extremely&&; ... although in, delaying gained the power and transformed the democracy for always in.
the conclusion, the same are that in the old, is that the society current. on in discredit the benefit individual, have in account the interests common.
the capital private not is able, in their essence, of understand and the benefits of of the society.
the result is the same that the of then, a quickly of the elite, unprecedented,, that is be a effort for them in depth.
the causes the on of the regimes on and want must other, for what therefore, in the liberalisation quest of the systems economic in the century 19th and 20th.
with mentions to the situation current, is possible be the disappearance of these systems in benefit of a democracy of such liberal, as a welcome always, to the expected the next coup.
the fact really is that the elite current efforts for completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, disasters social and humanitarian of the that we been we, and as the crimes against the humanity,, and as the we in the history former and the more recent.
the suspension of the law on contracts public not is the means; all tolerant not to long long-term.
under pressure of the competition economic, and to level international as within of the eu, the government of the republic czech is be obliged to to for other to for reduce the level social of the population.
this trend is, for what therefore, systemic.
the solution is for reforms specific, that strengthen and the involvement the capital the state as the influence of the citizens in the government and that the position of monopoly the capital private in the society in benefit the state.
israel: the laboratory the chaos.

after of the recent waves of violence between israel and the strip of gaza, have that, as always, reactions.
one, the side of israel, to favour the right of all-out and to the palestinians in the role of terrorists. the another to the palestinians and look racism for part the state of israel, genocide gaddafi against arabs palestinians and denigrated to israel of state terrorist.
not i on in who is guilty of the bring that is and who is the victim. ones end and the out, the citizens of today in day of israel, were the territories schedule, wells within of the situation policy current and not a the beginning of the violence.
my intention is offer to the amongst behind the iron, a look for out who from of the tensions that is unchanged since ago 95 years( accounts to from of the declaration in november of 1917) in a small ground of earth the east a.
some of my considerations is based in facts historical, other in conclusions to the that have have on the basis of my irish way of understand the subject, on who or what group of people is the drive main of the events of the history modern.
in the history of the mankind the history of the struggles by the power is in first class.
in every time we find a go at or a rostopchine.
but what that no not is so clear is if always were these- the which commensurate their steps of way north-east or if behind of their had someone that their actions of a particular aim.
we generated which we in a time that the wealth the world in the hands of on saa individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this means, not. has been to in a one generation.
of between these families a least a that could be the more prominent( if still there someone behind, not what i, but not the rule): the security.
not. a to close of them.
of.
in the years 90 the century 19th bought the first agency of news( doing) for which any of include their name with acts of so is. the power and the wealth, or two, they the, thing that for they always manifesto a deepening.
have cautiously important in almost all the banks the world and in those countries in the which not are represented, is has of or is is preparation a war: before the on to afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack of no thirty-four 5, after of removing to gaddafi only they four, but in russia has the bank central the government russian.
all that that has tried one to this family has dead.
prophet is. refused to initiated the state the individual central bank of america of the security, began for the war of secession to this money and was murdered in is in the acting.
play to this money and wanted suspending the system of reserve federal( states) and was murdered in 1963; the louis was poisoned the year refused after of on to the states for have resulted the great crisis economic the year 1929.
its now for the power world them during the years- to for a plan with three truth world, designed for the bernard bernard, emblem with the degree 33.
the first war. set as aim eliminate the large states in all europe; the& eliminate the colonial, especially of a britain, and the third is initially reduce the population of the earth between a million and thousand million of people( time amount of slave for its welfare and to would and not resources), well of the creation of a religion universal( the not is nothing more that a draft for such solution) and the adoption final of the powers.
the method with the that operates the group of the families more a, together with the security, still the provide the of crisis and the both of a solution(- to the chaos).
these solutions are,, however, grams, and threat always a in of the situation. if not, remember that the was established for that not. depended a crisis as the the year.
this that, after the success the murder the better to overreaction, which franz, in deficiencies and after of that, to as of this, is development the first war world, the russia tradition with the it of the revolution defended.
the first war world over of way degenerative and time since the point of view military and economic, the capitulation of germany( the wars for have with the russia tradition were already about) and the both of the a power of europe central, the empire overreaction.
for preparation the field of the second war world, authorities that the bankers and political grounds, of are hidden, a situation to as of the huge of war on germany, with what that. were the conditions excellent for the radicalisation of the about. subsequently, they with to the germans the solution the, that was what enough strong and that and to guilty, and to after a republic so for several and with a strong minority german that should represent and was so well the role of the fifth, that the out and was the outbreak of the war.
the end the century 19th, the the foundation the movement, a an that increase to the training of a state jewish, evidently in the region of the former with jerusalem as capital( the).
the declaration cited before did the foundations for the immigration mass of jews to palestine and imperfect the first conflicts with the population arab the place.
. setting attacks saudi in both parties.
the second war world: is difficult know if hitler bin too of the merry to the that what they the bankers international in a principle or if all what that was was part of a plan., however, the suffering of the jews european in the camps of concentration was the conditions excellent for the this the state jewish in the society world.
israel was monasteries officially in 1948 and, of are similar the way in that the county of war- to germany the way to the second war world, with the proclamation the state of israel is was the globe for a third war.
if the bankers international, the nation jewish, the as that in the second war world, is would in victim in first line of which, now and with the population arab or, generally, consider the east a.
israel is a laboratory relapse, a machine of and chaos, not only in the framework of their country, but also to level international. as example how is divided of are resulted the a and opponents of israel.
? who is guilty and who is the victim in the israeli-palestinian?? where the rise injustice in a spiral of violence drawn-out, if the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their intervening by the power world?
in this is is necessary distinction between the inhabitants of israel and their up, because, the as that is in our country, the bankers international by to their candidates in the elections.
the current president of israel netanyahu is the example of political fascist, to the bankers international, which ago all can possible for should the war to iran and, at that iran is member of the organisation of cooperation of shanghai( china, india, russia, pakistan ...), in become in a conflict global and, if we in account that iran controls the close of, by where is the 20% of all the oil world( the corridor of navigation has only two of ditches), actually to the destruction of the economy world.
under what light. show now the words which& does in 1994:&&; is peace. which we is a crisis general and the people will of agree with a new agenda world.&&;
the new agenda world in its imagination is a world of president and deprived.
a world in the that the rest of the population serving to a handful of people which that part of the usually financial well.
a world in the that to every new individual. you and a chip the; that controls all its be.
&&; and to all, small and large, rich and poor, free and deprived, to have a will in the hand right or in the on, to not power buy not sell, to not be which are the name of this introducing or the allowed of their name.

for that the lie existence remains, is& on the project film in, is was of press, the society of production had even a is real.
the detail on the operation is in secret for a time, the film is has as to from of the souvenir of.
the film of is a combination odd of several mixing.
for a on, a political realistic;& before, a called&&;&&;, the history of a episode that went well, a deception( a example can be the&&;- low-income).
in the film is combined the states of on. for a on well of tehran. in the sequence of budgetary is show do initiatives of the time of the events, that were the same way in the film; not there to this on.
for the one, used of hollywood a therefore more, marked for the and a potentially excessive.
and also, scenes of the central of the and other institutions: men which you the situation in the table of negotiations, in the corridors of the office, by telephone ...

the best scenes of the film have place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the events got. the of the decision-making of the embassy is by their capacity that, the same time, the need the and of the lack of has that from when, in some place, the history powerful a step forward.

the people to which save the republic, but am a amateur, it
mr senator,? how. you was have to the elections for president?
not is is of be senator or president.
if in our country would all well, then not would my candidacy.
but no not can bear see how. in the last twenty years in our country, how the only there unpunished, is standards the taxes and the age of retirement.
not i ambitions of be political.
when i something that not i do, to with a solution for change.
and since that already have on years and my candidacy is independent, the only possibility that have of change the things is coming as senator or president.
the senate already has come, but little after. has since in way to the presidency.
? not is giving the can to those people that what have voted?
always i that my for to the presidency of the results in the elections the senate.
more later that if region elected senator, would my for to the presidency.
but my do not is the; the is the tool with the that can to reality my own ideas.
for that the greater influence possible and the mandate more strong possible.
the problem not is only that us a nation that criticising in the bar or front of the television, but that to who that wants they a change.
to this. you cancel the media of communication, which you most and exclusively the freedom of expression with the freedom of union.
of quot is says that have to journalists or that have chamber advisory of paroubek paroubek.
we to about of their ideas.
. cool to the fight presidential with would financial and responsibilities criminal of political and the declaration of the property by above of 20 million.
for this must change the law.
as chairman not has this competition and only the senate in its whole can propose laws.
? how to?
as citizen, have involved part of a group of pressure for that the admire of on is should as work be, and the we.
the problem is in the policy: if someone a with a good proposal, it whether of right or of left, is helicopters to purpose and this affects to the citizens.
as candidate independent, have of a greater potential for obtain the support of all the groups parliamentary.
, not of party, the ability of power something of each party that be better for our country and apply.
?. as more well a man of right or of left?
since the point of view czech, have the impression that the people i seen more of left.
for me not has importance, it or a little of left or a little of sensible.
what that i should is that want forward.
not i should if someone is of right or of left, include to the people.
always support openly any solution good, regardless of whether the proposal it the or of the ods and, the same way,; in against of the bad ideas.
ago joke when is says of. that is populist.
? but not what is with what that says?
when. creates a plan business for the company, you also disproportionally objectives and ideals.
and to are.
will who it, but all the proposals of the that i already work in the world or known experts about of them.
but, the support the parliament only you there.
and with this not can survive in the policy to long long-term.
? or check you that if is who to the people and about with are, will, for example, a responsibility criminal and financial?
not have option option.
persuade to political, to journalists and to the society civil and to putting of my part for this.
if would elected president, not would problem in organise a europe-wide in direct for television in the which to the leaders of the parties parliamentary the the responsibility criminal and financial for political, officials, judges and tax the state.
and, eventually, them should that communicate& not the they.
if there a apos strong that out the disputes, is can to pressure in the scene policy.
take by case the election direct the president, which has been a achievement of the pressure public.
the same time tell that only am a amateur, not am not a solved or a intellectual.
for my views and ideals to allies.
just of start in the policy and bid obtain the greater support possible for my programme.
attempt from the things under i same, but in case of that not it well, within of six years what and the sector private.
i a little as if this to save the republic czech.
not am no salvador.
i that with a person not i nothing, for that have been to a number of personalities know, for feed to the better. to it its candidacy the senate.
went to see to, but. because had a work.
for my part, for what least have it to the journalist of research, that his to the light the fraud with talk of heating.
i outlined a of the basis of that the people is really feel, now am in the balance.
the sixty for% of the population not droves to the vote and, those that what did, voted to the representatives the wake.
in the senate we two the sector independent.
the people elected the senate, of, way that will complicated achieve changes.
, however, i my own ideas, as for example the election direct of or of governors.
? is at be its own party?
still not what have i because not have time for this, for check the last unblemished of each one of the potential states the party, not not have money.
not have money or for the campaign to the presidency, in my account transparent only there 20 billion.
? not has money?
about of he of the property,, how is the their?
clarification my property private in a 60 million.
in prague have a ground valued in 25 million, a out valued ten million, another out in eight million, a policy of works of art with a value of ten million, a martin of a 3.5 million and a valued in a million, and in the by a couple of million.
for true, have a martin because was my dream of youth. always i about james have, that seeing this car, was with the women and, the same time, against the and injustices.
? down a martin, their property is valued in 60 million and not has money for the campaign?
. says that to change the republic but not does to too money of their part.
not is very convincing.
not have 15 million to the.
? have that?
in the campaign already have one 2.5 million.
the fact of that not has no shows that not there too interest in my programme.
and not have the obligation of paying the campaign with money of my top.
the expenditure of the campaign in essence what that get in concept of salary of.
but not could life of this. for example, not could robbing to my son the school english, that costs 30,000 between.
if like only win money, then not i as candidate.
? this that continue with its activity business for power live?
? not has said before which was to to this activity?
this not has nothing which see with a greater.
as have come, in part have last my activities.
for example, the representative of my agency of air to be my substitute in spring.
the people would that would the that the republic.
but i also need live of something.
? how strings to win monthly as his?
between 200 and 400, that i gaining.
if would president, then the business.

and work, technical of apos in a great company saxony close of the library, finger:&&; addition, the building is it&&;.
but, i am for what we a library today in day.
all we internet, and books electronic.
nobody you for they in these big thinking of fashionable, we not?
, a city bedroom cathedral to the at of toys which hardly rewarded a visit, the questionable honour of having with a record for forget.
the population of marc inhabitants the rate of more low of the countries netherlands.
for to this situation so scandal, ago some years is decided make of any way to the culture general and stalinist, seven bridges false which copies represented in the notes of euro in a of of poured somewhat.
the success of the offensive was limited.
and this was as the responsible political s that only there a possibility for improve the statistics:! had that to a library!
, the can of architecture dutch, all a past in the art of the of there and responsible of buildings to the couple that orsay, is took the issue with their her act and to the presentation the contest in the year 2003 with five books under the it and a rights in the face.
and while the jury to their around and is of on, to blown the books for size its a and brought its short speech with the following words:&&; fellow:
here the you, my proposal for the mountain of books of, the so-called&&;&&;.
nine years after, the mountain of 30 million of eur is comments in the place to.
this in part the project of revival, that is full with a congestion underground, a supermarket, a office of post and a couple of buildings of residential and.
to at of november the mountain of books was medallists with the secondly prize&&; apos of areas 2012&&;.
also, the project also is the&&; national 2012&&;.
of this way, the small city sake of history, that to the date not had nothing more that to that a area pedestrian and a absurd decrepit after for white one more well a central country, account now with a you of architecture contemporary.
but on all, at now the first cultural public of their history.
the long way to the book
the first impression is that is is of a of books under a.
well is true that there a lift that we hold fair the centre of this poisoned, but the real dracula the space and the not what tallow, but that with its to every step of their escalation to the now.
the internal completely is adverts and easy of postal with the at, the soil of mortar and the cool support of a his the condition public of the library.
the environment urban is perfect.
the raise the view is can to to the banks the volume, the dogs and the children and girls playing the football.
and for all both books, books and more books.
&&; the shelves of books are to the long of the on and in the centre is gives a enormous here are that, for what general, often be something be and reply&&;,.
what that we fact we is to this this the classical space and from the area of reading the internal the outside.
the internal of the mountain is very well offered: in the a. i the offices, the library of internet, the club of being, the centre of education environmental and the room of peacekeeping.
mention special deserve the shelves they which to the functions of coating, and the same time.
the at, the and the are talk.
even the architects and the engineers civil most the day the head when about of this non-us unknown.
&&; with materials recycled&&;, we postponed, head the project in the city of.
and this is as a day, in a exploitation agricultural, we setback with the by-product for from of the agriculture.
since ago many years, in the greenhouses and in the camps of the countries netherlands is used a of millimetres of anything as basis for the roots of the on.
is is of a material cheaper and efficient.
this fine takes two and after is established.
for the library this., for first time in such quantities, to to of four involve of anything.
with the heat and the pressure, the so-called agricultural() do of colour and. becomes in a material dark, having and, that to a mixed of car new and of sport.
after frontage. is to the now of the mountain.
the end of this map offers of almost 500 metres around of the mountain we the to: since the not only with has a fantastic at of the city, but that in she also. can enjoy of a famous and their in huge flower.
these producing a environment to the couple that have the content for this mountain of literature.
donations for a new soul
&&; though costs this their large land go, this is a project exemplary in what that as to the connection&&;, states.
the heating and the cooling necessary is of to from of energy biofuels.
to despite of that the mountain of books is for under a great of glass, even in the days more the sun only which for few hours in their internal.
the huge to wood in sense merge to the on of- have for to shadow and the most of the – the sun.
this creates a climate internal.
the rest is thing of the.
work, the worker the sector of the technologies of the information, already is has courage to to the ordinary in the new library.
and also has state there.
also, the in of medicine traditional china her has visited the library. she described the&&;&&; as the& quot; distinguished& quot; of.
the reason is that, with we of the opening that had place ago a couple of weeks, is married to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of their policy private.
of this in. to fill, of time, the concerning of a library that yet not account with its archive completely; in the, has 70 shadow.
the concept has of quot.
the shelves are.
&&; not there nothing worse that a library a half&&;, the.
&&; i that thank to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a true link with this building.
all know that its book in part of the library.
although only is there for.
of this become, the study has we all a success in this discipline that in the is known as&&; creation of a identity&&;.

whatever of what youngest and that can be.
for end a point of for for shaping its identity.
:&&; the germans must play a role more leading&&;
germany. has abstained in the vote on the admission of palestine.
according first, expert in the relations., this to berlin in a position diplomatic quite tricky.
monopolist: to at of week, germany was to understand that advised in against of the proposal of give to the be palestinians the condition of state observer of the nations un.
, however, but berlin. others.
? for what?
first: germany not is what which the israeli have fact in gaza.
now well, because to the relationship special that holding the country with israel, germany must have care.
but the same time i that not supports the position detected.
germany wanted to its independence, be too critical with israel.
for the political that had place in libya in march of 2011, germany also. when of what that is were was of establish a area of ban of flight.
this has been malpractice finally for the a.
? you is difficult to germany adopt a position clear when are in at issues international important?
itself, and is.
this. because to that in these at is its policy foreign, approach of a policy, for this it, for the states united and in a policy foreign german.
and what that difficult still more the things is that the european not have one policy coherent and uniform.
for what therefore, the germans is are in a crossroads.
of them is expected that- a role more independent, but not are used to do.
i that still are operating what will its role, but already have on the way to one policy foreign&&; normal&&;.
a policy consolidate similar to the countries as france or great britain.
? what means to one policy foreign&&; normal&&; quot the point of view german?
is one policy that, when. is of interests national, is shows prepared to defend different to the of states united or their partners european.
i that the policy foreign german is a strong learning in the policy economic, is say, in the exports and in their relations with certain regions, as can be russia, china or middle next.
the interests economic germans are to true point different to the of other large powers and for that reason germany must protect their interests.
? these interests about have affected in the position over with on the conflict in middle next and in the vote of the un?
for a on, germany of with large markets in east next, especially in the gulf.
for this reason must be poppy and not alienate of the opinion public arab and channel of the admired arabic.
this is important, for course.
but i not you so importance since that not. is of a relationship avowed unilateral.
, however, themselves play a role fundamental in the considerations german.
? has- germany its relationship with usa. us. the from of vote in important decisions as in the vote on palestine?
i that in europe, and even in states united, the position german it of a great degree of understanding.
for this reason, not i that. has been a break so drastic as in the case of libya.
perhaps with this germany has failed; a true respect.
the end and the out, all this not has fact but to that is a country the that take in seriously as actor international and whose interests there that have in account.
in europe there different views about of the initiative palestine.
in change, usa. us. is has shown gases to favour of a veto.
? there simplified of views between. us. and many nations european?
always have been these disparities owing to the policy internal us.
i that the government of obama shows in secret a great understanding to the position european.
but, to cause of the situation policy that is who here, is clear that the government not can defend in public that position.
i that the real simplified of an not has in reality the be that is you attaches.
if opportunities the relations between obama and the prime minister israeli netanyahu, at which obama not is no nothing happy with the policy that develops.
? you is difficult to germany reconciled the disagreements relations which involvement with israel and states united, for a on, with the position of their main partners in the eu, by another?
i that is precisely that what that ago that be so difficult for the germans.
for course that would a little more easy for the germans if had one policy european coherent and allowing, but not is the case.
for what therefore, not have the possibility of be part of a napoletano, but that must promote the things since its own position.
that is precisely what that are doing now with the euro.
i that in the future germany financed a role of leadership to the in of ours to europe to adopt a position european.
for course that this not is nothing easy for germany, it or merely for the relationship that in with israel.
this has been always a issue tough.
but i that the germans have clear that must play the role of issues independent.
?. is germany to themselves same in the role of international important?? to in reality germany taking a role leading?
? or perhaps you still break difficult accept that leadership?
germany yet not is has, always is something you and, for reasons are, the country you still collapse play a role more important.
if at the crisis the euro, for example, at that every time that germany. an as actor main, is completely certain hurt.
this not is easy for the germans.
is is of a old problem and is that no to be on of the countries ethos.
seen of this way, germany. is in a position a more difficult that states united.
must in a attitude inclusive an to the different neighbours and views and this not is easy.
the influence of us. us. in the policy european having every time more, but the eu not by of time that we,? is then?
to the not them support most no that taking a role more leading.
even if not them do, if them to unpleasant or if they systems in a people still more unpopular, c&&; est the vie!
first is director director of the academy transatlantic in washington, a institution in the that and experts in policy from of europe and of america the northern of a joint the challenges to the that. facing the community transatlantic.

&&; of trademark&&; in china: when and is of suddenly in trademark chinese
is a will to level world and side also.
but,? why is side?
after this name. is a designation officially in china but that not has nothing which do with the companies original.
not however, this be of protection while the not tried a demand.
and even then not is clear that. they will to to the reason.
&&; to the foreigners they& every time more difficult protect their up in china&&;, he, lawyer the in violations of rights of protection in far east.
every week is to my table a new case.
the imitators simply add a couple of to for power stated their up.
of this way, is becomes in and in instead of is with.
the companies they also. unfortunately legally of the same way,, and as you has happened the manufacturer of goods deal.
opens a data in the that similarity of the office of trademark of beijing.
the 14 of september of 2010 a company china requested stated the mark, a name and that also is useless of the house of fashionable.
that the of are champions world in that of and of disseminating the rights of property intellectual is of well-known known.
in the large cities there it stocks of several will from only to the sale of number.
, however, the cases of are of another nature. for of their customers, he struggle against the fact of that the office of trademark of a official to the companies chinese the right to from from of a designation that already is in one place.
the chinese it call&&;&&; or and.
the word has its from in the term chinese&&;&&;,
which ago i to women a have&&;&&; to a man wealthy.
the authorities chinese not. feel guilty
&&; is harmful for the business, there that fight against this&&;, requires.
&&; the mark ago waters, the position and the damage that are the image is enormous.&&;
the losses state and the procedural of the sectors problem are, on all in the case of products flagship of luxury.
according data of the company of analysis of market, with a volume of 15 million of eur to china is, in size, the third market of goods of luxury and the which growth to greater pace.
, however, achieve the written-off of gross of therefore legality in the registration of trademark is complicated and resulting is a money.
the processes. can over to nine years and the result is uncertain.
about of cases in the that the court a demand because had been and time that the name this of the demand already is had become in a&&; emasculate of&&;.
&&; if the has bad we, perhaps even has that pay money the because the process has done to the mark of apart in china&&;,.
in on this is the law of the jungle.
some of the cases more known have that see with elements put.
in 2009 lost a he against the manufacturer of machinery of construction, the company that has been ago little for the from german of bombs of poured.
for that to day of today the chinese can continue they a emblem very similar to the star of mercedes.
the must of,, his the principle a logo in white and blue that had in great measure to bmw; the matter is in the courts and difficulty that happened.
the manufacturer of clothing lost in china against imitators from of kong coming and singapore whose logo amounted a crocodile looking in the direction opposite to original.
the authorities chinese not. feel guilty.
the office of trademark in beijing they that in 2010 have had difficulties owing to the shortage of equipment and funding of personal.
the year last,, however,&&; the situation of emergency labour submitted to the it&&;.
of this way, the amount of processes of complicated, is has small in a 22%.
almost of these cases is worked been, a 75% more that the year previous.
, however, complaints are outstanding of resolution.
fight against this costs a money
as takes be her in china, the figures are to.
the year last the registered more of 1.4 million of applications of protection of trademark, almost a third more that in 2010.
is would of a new record and means which china for tenth year running the list of new in in all the world, according out the office of trademark.
seems that this also happens with the number of shops valid, figure that 2 to 5.5 million in total.
in 2011. would are million of equivalent in concept of rights.
said of other way, this means that of average every costs equivalent or 160 eur.
fight against this costs a money,, and as shows the case of the company family german.
since ago more of seven years the group exception in the courts against a chinese.
if well the germans have we be the manufacture illegal of in of car of imitation,
the has achieved ensure the rights chinese on the mark.
&&; is we caused this situation because in germany the not are protected&&;, states, president and of in munich.
the office of trademark also the resource of the.
in the two following drawn he have given the reason to, but the part opposite still set in the currently.
there that have great care
now the case has have to the at the court napoletano of justice, where still outstanding of resolution.
is in power solve it the question and extolls the professionalism of the courts.
, however, also says that&&; the procedure is extremely expensive, and in terms of money as of stresses&&;.
is difficult estimate the costs internal; the business has had that we of to foods years of, for power to evidence.
ago five years to the part opposite one&&; of six figures in for&&; with the aim of an to a agreement friendly, but not had success.
&&; this the a that sit care&&;,.

my crisis of identity
says that many is crash install to leave mexico because to the is of opportunities
the improves are to criticise to the that. were; quot which request to the interest of those times difficult
appointing which the. are a between two worlds.
in a recent travel to city of mexico, gross had had for the on and comes to the area of to of immigration and already was completely confusing.
a notices the way to two allowed: a for&&;&&; and for&&;&&;.
i was there a seconds, be sure to where should go.
the have by in central, during all my spectator i have for&&;&&;.
is is of ethnic, the same way in that my friends of is concern to itself same as&&; as&&; or may friends of new york. to itself same&&;&&;.
more dealt i compare for&&;&&;.
but this was mexico.
and, in the homeland of my grandfather, the or the repeat not were necessary.
simply was us.
i spanish. the enough well as for for a interview in this language.
but not have the level of of a and not can of my american.
this that minutes my passport us and i already in the holding of foreigners.
had in that time of this week in the that the president of of mexico, allowed, visited the home white for meet with the president obama.
in the agenda the day, as always that is instead the leaders of these two countries,: immigration, drugs and trade.
allowed was to also the growth of the economy this, a of the reasons by the that in these at is so likely that a mexican. will in mexico as that is will to go to the states united.
to would with states united and canada and create in america a bloc trade the lifestyle of the union european.
also, allowed promised to fighting against the which of the drugs in mexico, but not was detail.
for mexico, the relationship with the states united is one and is full of.
probably the most of never is of that in 1848 the states united warsaw mexico and to their leaders to one the half of their territory to at of pistol.
but for the improves, which think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that. the request are for all parties.
this that, in the time in the that a official of the states united says any thing that such the more minimum criticism to mexico, to hear complaints, therefore in the press as between the elite have, on how the americans are the sovereignty of their neighbours.
and the children of is are in being of war.
and still this, for mexico, the relationship that really is all a challenge is the which have with the more of 35 million of which living in the states united.
? we of?
there a.
in mexico there winners and losers, people for the that the country provided of and other for the the not is this.
the only reason for the that there so people of pay up weariness in cities as the angels, the,, or the is that, in some point of our, there a person, can which the father or the mother or have of the grandparents, to the that. you came the door of the opportunities in mexico and had that leave to the north.
and the most of the sometimes he modern in a profile particular: reinforcing are, a level of studies under, from of a people poor, etc.
we we their top-down and them are loyal.
to mexico not.
and, to despite of that may which weariness now the dream american, the have and to good colleges and have had good jobs, not we lose never of view that what that are living is that, the dream american, and not the mexican.
is possible that to sometimes our identity not is clear, but our itself that what is.
is for the states united.
also, are we of that to many of the lot to the elite of the class not them.
the sense is mutual.
us, as a reminder of a defeat humiliating and we watching for above the i as if of a category latin that not is what enough.
our spanish never will what enough good and our links with mexico never will what enough strong.
to their way of see, our these is synonymous of failure.
if our families not have in mexico, not. that gone.
and now not we we a after this of tough, weariness well in the states united but, still this, as.
my woman, which born in and wine legally to the states united when was one girl, i reminds which there this between the improves and the because the first know with more who are and to the seconds this they.
although is citizens of the states united, she. as part of the two countries.
while meanwhile, many which which not are part of none of the two.
we listen the group mexican the the north, but also to.
you after best of every country, but not you to none of them.
in mexico we, as billion.
and in the states united is we as interest.
now, for more still more the things, for what that i have found during my journey, some leaders and some intellectuals want return to people with the.
want which the entire as&&; by&&; of mexico makeshift, their interests in the states united.
to our colleagues americans the fantastic that is visiting that country and to the leaders political for that their links with mexico.
itself, clear ...
that not is to to.
there too.
and, with the inequality of wages, the corruption and the violence for drugs, many of us not we so insurance of that be a country fantastic.
i am which you to be alone with this idea, friends.
is fair.
if some – not are ready for spare to the states united for the a in the that to mexico ago a century and a, then have which accept the fact of which some still are for how. to their family years least time.

keynesian battles, new east a
the high the ceasefire between israel and hamas well could be a basis little likely for the peace
? will have some day a peace lasting between arabs and jews in east a?
another to of blood which seems indicate that any hope is in vain.
in a of the so and arise discussions on who started first, of buildings have been incomes to rubble; more of 140 palestinians, the most of them civil, and six israeli have been killed and, for first time, rockets from of gaza have fallen close of tel on, the a of israel, and the city holy of jerusalem.
but, to despite of that the israelis and the palestinians seem be sections in its former conflict, all as they in middle a is changing.
the spring arab what has no all fact education they whether or not, and israeli have been a in the regional.
perhaps this do that its fight be still more bloody that before.
, however, there reasons for good that its situation of point deadlock could.
a war that and is and is earns
to first at, the optimism appears currently very difficult of justify.
even if is in the high the ceasefire agreed on 21 of november, the clashes of this week have have to the cries of both camps.
the leaders of hamas, the movement islamist that has we gaza since 2007, having prompted to the israeli to from, to despite of that gaza has received a good him.
and to despite of having rocco to some of their leaders and to pressure to the 1.7 million of people of gaza in one of the they most live and the planet, israel not has been have with hamas.
of fact, hamas is gaining ground in bank, the other part of palestine currently by their implacable of fatah, the palestine more a.
also, the leaders of hamas could, to the conclusion of that the time to its favour.
given that the from have gaining influence for all the world arab, hamas has fact and argument.
turkey, a regional that before had been the ally muslim more to israel, has espoused the cause of hamas. also the has fact qatar, one of the states more wealthiest and the gulf.
the member of hamas say that the average crescent is israel, since the lebanon the north, where that on, and for syria, where the rebels of a trend every time more islamist could regime to by, to reach to jordan, where the allies of hamas are continue the king.
on all in the with of israel, the growth of the muslim muslims resulted for the president in egypt, with difference the more populated and fundamental of the countries arab, has changed the balance of the region.
hosni mubarak, the point that- in egypt for 30 years to its fall in 2011, not had too time for hamas.
in change, the muslim muslims are brothers of hamas and their leaders on more of the opinion popular.
in burdens actions, is possible that hamas involved as leading the that not. can an, not even israel and the states united.
while meanwhile, the went takes of israel the conclusion opposite.
in what that. as the question military, have to hamas in its get.
the system missiles of iron of israel has shown its effectively and many of the rockets of hamas have been destroyed.
the israelis more calmer ... for some time.
in as to the diplomacy, states united. also more by that never; many countries europeans also to hamas of having that the it wave of violence.
to all, israel has been. notably under the government of benjamin netanyahu, a first minister that has ignoring this the process of peace.
although the rockets fired since gaza have killed with the life of on 30 israeli since 2004, israel not has had many terrorists, in part thanks to the barrier that bank, the main part of a territory to become in state of palestine, and the vulnerable jewish which still to despite of that, according the international, are illegal.
the mr netanyahu, whose party fighters. has joined to a group of a line still more takes adolf for in the period run-up to the elections on 22 of january, is in a good position.
? for what to these palestinians a state own?
if really in bank, we not, and as have fact its for in gaza?
is better they that and them a good coup if moving the head.
perhaps. will the takes, although the spring arab could main their are.
although the from the take the power in egypt and in other not have too to israel, their priority will address the difficulties internal.
the budget of defence of israel is greater that the of their four neighbours arab together.
like a war with the superpower of the area to the new governments to improve their economies.
that the firm mr has worked with barack obama for to the high the ceasefire is a good well and could a the it of something.
also the israelis should think to long long-term.
with the rest the world arab more democratic, tourist to the palestinians of their law to the is create a minute that a day in the territories from for israel, of the same way that this week a bus in tel on.
the repression already is destroying the democracy in the state jewish and the ageing is the situation to measure that is the population arab.
the missions against within every two or three years for who to hamas they a upper diplomatic every time greater.
both respects need a push of people prepared the conflict.
the solution still remains the that people of both camps, the most the world external and this newspaper: two states and the measure of territory for part of israel for reasons of security.
the hope, to short long-term, is that the high the ceasefire it a little more of impetus to the people that are fighting for this cause.
egypt, which must start to to curb to the entry of weapons in gaza, together with turkey and qatar, is is in a situation, unprecedented for persuade to hamas of that accepts the idea of a state jewish based in the borders of 1967, with exchange of earth and a jerusalem shared.
the arabs the terms also should on to hamas and fatah for that. unite.
that routes more to the creation of a state palestinian that the attempt of we a category of state virtual in the un.
the mr obama also has a important role in what that as to to carry to israel to the table of negotiating.
for its first mandate it its own plan for the peace.
of again in the house white, european as of to roma its attention.
this contemptuous is a record vision of future.
a east a stable is of vital interest for the states united.
this means a agreement of peace between israel and palestine.

not you will to to.
a day in a airport waiting to which when a flight is quite at, even if you media for be apos, as books, or, without not of the shops teamwork.
but every time there more increased and experts in development child that the arm the dull.
according they, is well that, and we as our children, we of time in when.

given that, currently, the most of us are to this or to that screen, not we the benefits the is the dull.
this that,? should it of good on the dull?
itself.
and not.
but, already we of this more forward.
in first place, the as that very people, supposed that, now that we of more time for the, the charge would a phenomenon relatively recent.
but,, and as it a, professor of history and seen of the university of calgary, in canada, and author the book&&;: to&&;(&&; the charge, a history,&&;) published in 2011 for university press, not is this.
&&; of fact, the history the charge is very explanation&&;, says.
in the walls of there in on the charge which traces the century i.
also we consider how define the dull.
&&; the is that already is has defined and this of very various ways&&;, john chairmanship, professor of of the university of in, canada.
after the research and means the idea to a group of several all-ireland for 100 people, the professor and their colleagues defined the charge as the experience of&&; prevent, but not power, part in a activity that you full&&;.
says that the difference between the charge and the is that the opportunity not ago i but to do.
out that with the not there the he of to something.
the experience main the dull, says, is&&; the the process of attention, problem to a under state of mind and to a been of that the time people&&;.
the dull can sounding thrown kind to the depression.
, however, the professor says that, although can be that, the people that are to see the problem as a question the environment or the world, while that the people that are about that the problem what have are.
to sometimes we that we, when what that we is in reality is that we problems for work.
in its study&&; the: in of&&;, road in the issue of september of the magazine on for, the professor and their colleagues. made to a experiment previous in the that the participants a of a person that the article of a magazine.
some groups heed in the room permanent a programme of television to all volume the not bore no relationship, other what heed with the volume under, of are that hardly was, while that the third group not here the check in any at.
the group that here the programme with the volume under more charge which the other two groups; they funded focus, but not were in of by what and what the dull.
&&; platform in a task difficult or interesting, the at of the attention can more to charge&&;, mark donnelly, professor of of the university of, in, and one of the authors the study.

&&; and research that which those! to the that. they allows! more and observation more information that to the that. they who to be&&;, the professor.
all we what that is in some at: the delay of a aeroplane, a speaker whilst, a film particularly dismally.
but some people have more trend to that others.
for help to, some researchers in the years 80 a&&; of trend the charge&&;.
the scale includes issues as&&; many of the things that have that to are repetitive and&&; and&&; emotion otherwise things which i interested which not have time of this all&&;.
first, professor of of the university of own florida, it that, they these, the researchers have discovered that the home have more trend to more to often that the women, and lula need more external and more tamil-speaking.
but, in general, the adolescents are a kind of group that is boring with quite easily.
in 1991,, professor of development human and community of the university of from, was to out a experiment in the that is in contact with 400 adolescents and with their parents between seven and eight sometimes the day by a towards.
found that on 32 for% of the adolescents which. while was in the school or the duties, while the the 23 for% said that. when not was in the school.
for other hand, the 3 for% of the parents got which..
the professor said that not did if the rates of current, 21 years after, would with or lower.
but said that what that itself did was that&&; the is a period in the that the charge is its most high&&;, in great part because to that and to the children as to the adolescents not. they given a great control on what that they to.
this that, have to my question the principle:? is good?
to their not what is, it which, post-communist the extreme, can to that we to risks affair absurd, as to odds-on or venture in the consumption of substances as method for combat,, and as by the research.
for other hand, many and support of the connection between the charge and the creativity, according says the professor, which has state departments this question for more of two decades.

but the brainwash not always do what is what more appropriate.
if you at and you that energy for an the or cooking, that you satisfy.
but if see the television, is possible that you to short long-term, but not to long long-term.

&&; us as to criminal&&;, gucht.
? and what are?
in the weeks of uncertainty following to the vote that had place in for the legalisation of the bringing of small quantities of marijuana for use for, the response in hundreds of causes under by for of drugs is than of the law that of the location.
hundreds of crime under by his of marijuana is are and here as in the state of washington, where is adopted a measure similar.
the departments of police have no of the charges against the over of 21 years for to small at, which is will legally a time the law has entered in force in the next weeks.
but the tax of could more conservatives of write is have committed to continue forward with the cases open for his of marijuana and still are to people.
the same time, several cities, since the suburbs of denver to the mountains western, are for prevent that. checkpoints of marijuana, authorised recently, in their communities.
&&; would this is changing so quickly that not i what will what next&&;, told donnelly, head of police in, fair the this of denver.
who is of the it in the state of washington also are quibbling around the subject.
and still for advice for of a system of licensing of production, chengde, distribution and sale; would like before of that it the date limit, the 1 of december of 2013.
say that, for well or for wrong, is for, of the most of the states in on to the regulation the use of the marijuana, guards with for and now for use for.
&&; at of a market more regulated, and that will a good guide&&;, mr smith, for of the commission of control the alcohol the state of washington.
but the mr smith accepts that any place or system only can to you on what that could work.
&&; not there a real precedent that we as of model&&;, says.
the law of washington,, you in force the 6 of december, the that is also a year for the which. between two waters, it the the system of licensing in that state yet not will, but the his will legal.
also, there some issues sensitive the must resolved for that period, as the way of and a balance between the demand the state of; a&&; quot& quot; to the marijuana charged and their ban of make his of grams in a radio than to 300 there of schools, parks, areas of children or it children.
&&; in any place finished more difficult a business of grams cheaply that in the areas urban, especially in the area cause of seattle&&;, gucht, the centre for the legal, a group of research created recently.

currently, amounted people is struggling to posts for his of 56 or than of marijuana, although many of them have other.
&&; responsibility the obligation of appeal actions judicial against those the in the at in that is there were crime&&;, said the mr in a statement.
the answer has been one even in places as the rural of table, where the voters the initiative on the legalisation of the marijuana.
the police of continued, the largest city the county, no not meeting to adults for his of small quantities.
, tax the district the county, supported this decision, but also austrian not underestimating none of the cases outstanding by his.
&&; not i that is losing the time the to doing to the law to that this changes&&;, said.
to despite of that the 55 for% of the voters the measure, never is was that take the consumption of marijuana for use for the within the government and the system legal would to be easy.
the reactions which arise for all the state are of with a obvious ambivalence between the officials rübig the great experiment in this state.
&&; be is of a barrier cultural with the tax the district&&;, it are, a lawyer of denver that over to the was for his of marijuana and that is local of the organisation national for the reform of the law on the smoked.
&&; showed therefore time carrying to people to the courts that, in reality, yet not can accept that be legal&&;, said.
the be the first states that about the quantities small of marijuana of the same way that if would alcohol, and washington. prepare for become in the cases of test to level national in on to the legalisation of drugs.
while and officials the state they with a new border of sales legal, also expect receiving indications the government federal, which still no the moratoriums of the sale and the cultivation of marijuana as crimes federal.
the defenders of the legalisation of the marijuana have the hope of that the department of justice by.
to despite of that is have been some led searches of patients and sellers of marijuana for for, the government federal has allowed in its majority that there business of sale of marijuana with these for in, washington and 16 states more.
&&; though is likely that the they not look for boxes a bag of drugs small, probably is will volunteer to allow the to of shops by the state for the sale of marijuana for use for, in the new law&&;, said by, a of policy eu of the administration of obama.
several cities of not expect to that encourage the authorities federal.
even before the day of the elections, some governments local on any shop new of marijuana, to despite of that around of a year before of that who of them can open.

for my early weeks in oxford was more one that the one.
went in the university in september of 1986, was a young of 18 years terribly timid.
the hate to the party conservative was in its point more high.
the year previous, the university had voted can to- thatcher, former, a title&&; provide& quot; are the cutbacks in the funding of the education higher.
the environment would done horrifying of advance to any behaviour.

1.2 children
the that not. what great to the there is the government of singapore.
on distance the year in policies for encourage to the citizens to have more children.
a package the government for marriages and parents to 15 dollars for, the leave for on and benefits tax.
but all this has had little effect.
singapore is a city state richer and of high technology in the south-east of asia, also known for the sensible of their leaders and their strict controls social.
the rate of birth of singapore, of agree with its national of population, is to currently in 1.2 children for woman.
the last time that was for above of 2 as rate of was in 1976.
this that? for what the not have more children?
so, director of policies of are and family of the division ’ of population, says that is because to a&&; prowess& quot; and&&; a range more broader of opportunities of career&&;.
&&; that point has to the people have of a range more broader of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities, more beyond of intrigued and be one family&&;, postponed.
these changes in the rules social have the increase of the, and to delay the marriage and the, the that it as result a on of the rate of birth in singapore.
while meanwhile, a policy of immigration eu at to increase it the immigration for on to the in of the population has created between the population local.
in singapore there are websites where the xenophobia against many new immigrants, in particular the chinese, to the which critics for keep the wages netherlands and not integrated.
the increase of the immigration also is seen as one of the reasons by the that the year last the party of government of singapore their worst result electoral since the independence.
since the elections has there a attempt of to the problem, with the quotas and taxes more higher for the workers foreign.
consequences unexpected
while the the fall in the rate of birth has effects classical in the growth economic of a nation, the income tax, the costs health and the policies of immigration, the example of singapore also is taking some consequences unexpected.
the government is that not. athens so houses small.
for example, has begun to affect the sector measure.
the authority of development urban has there to control the number of home small, known as&&; box of&&;, that is they to in certain areas of the city.
these have land of 46 metres square and have had a success of sales.
, however, there concern of that they promote a with of life of and to the developers which want to eight large, family.
but quot soon, director general of the company collapsing the, says that their&&; boxes of&&; be giving a more quickly that the units more large.
are more popular, in the that of that the units is days, even weeks, more quickly that the units of largest size.
this ago that be a better for our flow of box.
, however, accepts that the new rules they guidelines most clear for the, to the that before is them you obstacles if wanted to prescriptive units small in a project.
too
singapore is a city state.
if well these new rules can be a step to the increase of the rate of birth national, the to with the which working in the district financial the centre existence that not will to have a effect.
&&; the is very marge, the eight are clear and also the is the education, for what that many people what are they&&;, gucht a youngest.

the five-year-old what to its family.
resolutely done office only of their disease and started to journal on she; with, effort that already its 43.
is,, doubt, one of the patients most ancient of the unit of hiv the head civil of guadalajara(), to the that came in 1994 after of several battles.
who with the virus of the line human( hiv) since ago 22 years, something difficult of somewhat to principles of the 90, when had many doubt, little options of treatment and more stigma.
then, to the director of a clinic the of he&&; not a cut&&;.
then, have aids was synonymous of death.
now is possible survive to this syndrome and do with quality of life.
, however, unaware of their disease, still a people they when the virus already has caused-,&&;&&; papers and are victims of to egotists.
to 31 years of the emergence the aids in the world, the than of the first cases reported,&&; the great achievement means in this at that the of a patient that as treatment in way have and the of the population general, is exactly as&&;, the head of the unit of hiv the,, after he that this information was in april of this year in a publication scientific.
and expert in hiv/ aids, said that since the year 2008, the scientists had a that the aids not was one; assumption, but the years of constitutes and the quality of life on the degree of the system in that have the patients the like the diagnosis, with better expectation for those not are users of drugs: to 30 years with a of 200 and of 50 years, when 500.
in words simple, the previous means that who it the diagnosis of hiv positive to the 25 years of age, under these terms&&; guerillas be in control will live, problems to, 75 years&&;, burkhard the ashraf.
for this progress, is remember that the hope of life of the mexican today is of 76 years in average.
if well the mortality has had significantly in the last years, in the case of mexico, the number of people which dying of aids of cases in 2007 to in 2011( annual of 500), also is true that since the published the aids, 60 for% of the patients in the basis of data national have died.
only in as people died in 2011, and deaths to may of this year; not however is ensures that there access universal to the medicines opportunistic from 2005.
-? for what still they deaths?
- to me i it which the problem not is of access to treatment.
this what, and we has happened in our hospital.
the least in the last 12 years not we had of the problem is that the patients they very advanced because not their state of infection, or be, in stages late of the disease.
was a fact overwhelming:&&; of each ten patients they when already presented a infection opportunistic what that is has that to for have a greater impact on the 1000 global, is to verdicts more and, for what therefore, is have that to evidence of detection of way and, to all the people that what&&;.
in its proposal specialists and officials the council state of prevention the aids in(), also the own patients, as, who communist to done the begins to a laboratory particular, only differ because what had fact a friend and, despite to their shorter age, it was in stage of aids and even of, a by cancerous that is one of the complications common.
all do when you which you aids.
some think which is will to die and not they to nothing.
&&; if longer i shall to die, i three their to the week&&;, say not in my case.
the change was for improve, i newborn well, i exercise, seriously the medicines.
to the date, their parents only who that cancer.
in a life normal, as who.
&&; work, done activities, i, have a life sexual active, but, i to me and to the person&&;,, who accepted share its with millennium for motivate with its to who today, in the framework the day world the aids, have fear.
that. should the test, if had risk, that between more soon source if are hiv positive, is best and whether already so the diagnosis, which that that can live as any person, with responsible.
that, its message, reaffirm the must of battle the aids this 2012.
