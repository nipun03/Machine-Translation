a strategy humble for hinder the re-election of obama
the leaders republicans justify their policy for the need of fight against the fraud electoral.
now well, the centre as this last a myth and says that the fraud electoral is least often in the states united that the number of people that die to cause of the fall of a like.
of fact, the lawyers republicans not have found more that 300 cases of fraud electoral in the states united in ten years.
a thing is certain: these new provisions will& to the rate of participation.
in that sense, these measures in part the system democratic american.
the contrary of what that happens in canada, the states american are responsible of the organisation of the elections federal in the states united.
and in that same line a majority of the governments american instance, to from of 2009, new laws that cancelled the process of for or of vote.
this phenomenon is has widespread after the elections of november of 2010, that were the increase of new representatives republicans in 26 states.
in result, for the year 2011 is introduced u-turn projects of law that assembly the exercise the right of vote in 41 states.
the new laws election are that the electorate be a document of identity with a was, also of a test of citizenship american.
for other part, these laws reduced the periods of vote abolish, the right to lobby as forrester in the day the polling and turn their right the vote to the citizens with background criminal.
before of the elections of 2006, no state american requirements that the electorate a document of identity with was.
the state of was the first in demand.
the court supreme of the states united this in 2008 the being of the law of.
for this, the authorities is quick to extend that practice to other states.
in the last years these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 states for force to the electorate to it a document of identity with was.
is important have in account that, the contrary of what that is in quebec, the citizens american not have of a document of identity universal, as the card of the security social.
of fact, a 11% of the citizens american, is say, 21 million of people in age of vote, not have with no document of identity with was we for a agency government of their state.
for another on, five million of new electorate in 2012 are of a document of identity with these characteristics.
but, to often, the obtaining the document of identity delays costs more of hundred dollars.
with what which, the new restrictions affect of way much to the young, the minorities and the people with income netherlands.
in effect, a 25% of, a 15% of people that who least of 35 dollars the year, a 18% of the citizens of more of 65 years and a 20% of the electorate of between 18 and 29 years not have with a document of identity with was.
and still there more.
in many states the students, the electorate that more vote to the candidates democrats, not can use the document of identity with was we for their institution.
for other part, these ourselves states follow to the member of the clubs of fisheries or of hunting that usually vote to the parties republicans to use the documents issued for these clubs.
before of 2004 no state requirements the test of citizenship for vote.
coldest was the first state in it this demand.
since 2011, a dozen of states has adopted laws that are that the electorate prove that are citizens american.
these measures for, clearly, limit the vote.
seems be that two of every three electorate support the party democrat.
for another on, the legislators republicans supported in 2011 certain laws that the for of electorate the same day the polling in eight states.
also, constrained the right of the people and the groups to create a service of aid to the electorate that is lobby.
these restrictions have consequences.
for example, in the elections general of 2004, the campaigns of for of the electorate contributed the registration of around of 10 million of citizens.
the measures taken since 2009 started that the rate of for of new electorate out in 2010 in compared with the year 2006.
also, the legislators republicans they laws in other five states that shock the reduction the period of vote for advance.
for example, in the elections of 2008 in florida, a 33% of the electorate that voted for advance were, while that these last not represented more that a 13% of the electorate the state.
in the case of the happening exactly what same.
these not represent more that a 11% of the electorate, what that is to a 24% of the citizens that vote for advance.
, however, the white, that represent a 76% the electorate, not represent more that the 46% of the citizens that vote for advance.
for course, the legislators democrats and their supporters is have therefore a to the adoption of laws that party the registration of electorate.
in this sense, the governors democrats have blocked several projects of law.
the ministry tax of the states united intervened for decision the laws more controversial.
is could, in part, limit the damage.
for example, so only 16 of 34 states they the law that requirements the presentation of a document of identity with was.
, however, is undeniable that the new rules taken the exercise the right to vote in 2012.
the critical democrats it the nature partisan of the laws that is have voted, already that is clear that with them is to influence in the results of 2012 in the states key.
a report the centre of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent that of the talking votes necessary in the school electoral for achieve the presidency.
is too soon for that with certainty if these amendments legislative to at of system electoral will a impact significant in the results of the elections presidential of 2012.
a thing is certain: these new provisions will& to the rate of participation.
in this sense, the measures in part the system democratic american.
detection the cancer of prostate:? done the test or not apprising?
in effect, the test of psa is, in times, results unacceptably, with counterfeit results negative or even counterfeit results positive, after the that is decided to speeches medical so.
is a reason more that enough for to any to the men, already of for yes, on if should done or not the tests of detection.
? done the test or not?
we asked council to two specialists.
in the studies by in the states united is was a great rate of as between the groups of shows, for what that is difficult read these data and to recommendations ground.
for their part, the study european was certain difference of mortality between the patients that is had done the detection and the that not.
the study, with a monitoring to the 12 years, proved also that there between the 30 and the 40% of for of chronically metastases if not is has done the test of detection.
recommend, for therefore, the test to from of the 50 years, or to from of the 40 years if your father has suffered cancer of prostate.
the men of origin have a rate of risk more high.
the key is take a good decision a time been the cancer.
there cancer little and other cancer that are.
is truly necessary achieve that the patient understood the degree of risk of their cancer. is you must offer all the options possible and not necessarily treat the cancer of prostate that not citizen-friendly against the life to long long-term, in whose case is must has more well for a surveillance active of the disease.
today in day many men to the that is them has been a cancer not are treaties, since that said cancer not is anti-polish not one a risk for their life.
in their place, them we a surveillance active of the disease and, if this ahead, them we a treatment.
every time with more often criteria precise for decide who should or not be treaty.
recommend that is do the test in any case.
but is important that about with their doctor for determine if must done the test or not.
has created, in cooperation with the society international of, a tool that allows assess the pros and the pros the test of psa.

prevent the disease
unfortunately, not there a recipe miracle for prevent the cancer.
to despite of the progress of the research, the adoption of habits of life made are being the better way of reduce the risks of have the disease.
believe that if all the world well and is certainly what enough, is could prevent a 30% of the cancer.
&&; if nobody everywhere, that rate is 2.7, the least, the 50%&&;,, genève, spokesman of the society canadian against the cancer.
in change, that around the 10% of the cancer are as.
many other are being completely hourly.
for the society canadian against the cancer, the fight against the smoking still being a priority to despite of the in the number of smokers.
the tobacco is with with the 85% of the cases the cancer of lung.
is, also, a factor of risk for other types of cancer.
it us the health of the people.
&&; today for today, still there 1.5 million of smokers in quebec&&;, declared the spokesman genève.
a fact hopeful: 10 years after of to of smoking, the risk of die of cancer is reduces to the half.
the weight
the and the obesity by also the emergence of the disease, according the.
tailbacks the risks of cancer of breast, of bowel and of totally, of related, of and of womb.
&&; the research shown that the practice regulate of activity physical for all the life it against the cancer of breast&&;, in.
the food
the body should, also, limit the consumption of it red.
in large quantities, do wishes the risks of have a cancer colorectal.
the products of also must avoided.
the preservation of the meat for their, fodder or provided can to the training of substances carcinogenic.
&&; can damage the cells the body and to the development the cancer&&;, we for.
the vitamins
in the last years, several scientists have examined the ties between the complex tell and the cancer.
, however, for the at their research not are unconvincing.
the, the studies about of the moment and are contradictory.
while that in one of them is discovered a in of the risks of cancer of prostate, in another what that is observed was, more well, a increase.
the effect of the moment d in the cancer not is has been determine with clarity.
for other part, gijs genève should in the importance of about on the concerns and the background family of every one with their doctor.
&&; to the test of detection not from cancer.&&;
the of in detail
the announcement the likely discovery the of equal a great shock the summer last, and with reason.
is believes, in effect, that this is involve the mechanism responsible of the mass of all what that there in the universe, nothing more and nothing least.
and what that is more, is is of the whose existence snowfalls the model standard: our better or&&; least bad&&; explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the on, that still not has been seen economically.
but for the physical not is completely clear that is involved of.
we, place to doubt that there a new and that is seems a the of predicted for the model standard.
also, new data this week in a important congress of physical fact in kyoto seem confirm that yes what is, although still and more data for be completely insurance.
of all ways, we that is is of, already that the for of you seem few. will of what is is.
there, in this great world, a law widespread and absolutely that means that two things not can is in the same place the same time.
not there way of infringing that rule and not what trying too, because will manipulating damage.
although the physical of the particles be a world very complex, is has shown that also in she there a law of these characteristics: the principle of exclusion of, that stipulates that two particles not can should the same space the same time if are in the same&&; state&&;; a&&; state&&; that certain, achieve way, of some of their characteristics.
the physical classify the particles in two categories.
for a part we we with the good citizens called, that supporting wisely the principle of.
and for other are the, a laundry buffoons of that not has respect for nothing, or the least not for this principle, what that means that can is in the same place and the same time.
according the indeed website the of the laboratories that, for true, is extraordinary, the is into in two groups: the restaurateurs, of the that not we here, and the&&; particles of force&&;, for the that the large forces of the nature is epidemic and with the which the of would of any in.
these, be stress here, not are the that we believe.
of fact, if by read this risk, is thank to a extremely trivial: the or the&&; of light&&; that it as&&; shoot&&; of the force electromagnetic.
in effect, when a with a burden we accelerates or time of direction,&&;&&; the field in that be environment; a little as when we a stone to a pond.
in this&&; at&&; stems a wavelength electromagnetic( of the light, of the infrared, of the optical, etc.), and this wavelength not is other thing that a; is say, one of the&&; carrying of force&&;.
field more stable
happens what same with the of, with the difference of that is is of another field, the field of, that needs be&&;&&; for that this hang.
now well, the field of is great more stable that the field. for ago lack to to energy extremely higher, a little as if is like of a pond came in the that so only a rock could avoid for the surface.
for this ago lack a the put of particles as the of the cern(! the great of is a ring of 27 km of circumference!) for achieve such levels of energy.
the upon with the field is a new tool that it the relationship between the and the mass.
of fact, not all the particles not all the materials royal with the field.
some, as the toy, what do, but other not: a paper of role, for example, not is will never for yes same grass-roots to the door of a begin.
and of the same in, not all the particles royal with the field of: the that what do have a mass, while that the rest( how the, for true), not the have.
now well,? what&&; can to&&; all these research?, question the madam.
for the science, this it for verify the validity the model standard(), and allows, also, that the physical the differences between the comments and the predictions the.
for their part, many want a that is are, therefore the will difference could open a door to a&&; new physical&&; that certain holes the model.
this, there that say, has still enormous shortcomings, as that not proposes explanation any on to the serious(!!) or to the on people, that constitutes around the 80% of the on the universe(! another!).
but not we found such differences in the cern to the at.
impact
the impact of these research in our day to day are difficult of predict, but not we that we let the say that not will no.
for that just: to at of the years 60, the pioneers the infrared in the laboratories not in at the revolution that their jobs.
the applications scientific, but nothing more.
of fact, as already said the physical, that worked in the laboratories, where is invented the infrared in 1960, and that a the first infrared we( the first were) in 1962, the principle the infrared was more well have a&&; would of laboratory&&;.
imagine ...
and also, the applications can also proceed of all the implementing that are to the research.
for example, the same a a of light in 1969 in the course of their research in on of angles.
to despite of that not was in at their intention original, this it now of&&; eye&&; for all the equipment digital the world, what that you thereby the nobel of physical in 2009.
that not to say, for course, that the activities the want necessarily into our lives, but that never is know ...
care palliative. the better in of die ...& at 124; you
in their commission die in dignity, quebec indian recently the sensitive question the end of the life.
the debate must again soon while is for a project of law.
now well, within of that dominance essential, still there a that to.
you has tried it of close.
ago hardly a weeks, the mr living only in their flat of the.

because, according the opinion of the majority of the people that working in care palliative, the large at have place in the heart same of that regression.
all the patients that entering in the centre of care palliative have cancer.
have a prognosis of life maximum of three months.
in that state, the team of doctors and nurses that them around already not offered the care&&; said&&;.
the greater fear of the mrs. by, of 89 years, is die&&; aware and&&;.
but the disease you has fact be to their children.

a 53% of the patients that are admitted in the centre next of their home and a 47% the hospital.
problem the access to care palliative
a 77% of the canadians simply not has access to the care palliative, is say, to the care some for alleviate the suffering when a ill is to the stage terminal of their life, be in their home, in the hospital or in a centre of care.
and several bodies, as the centre and the society of care palliative to home the cardiff, is almost exclusively in the care of the patients with cancer.
is precisely that great we on in the care health of quebec what that ago that many doctors mentions in care palliative farmer the adoption of a law that in the euthanasia and the suicide for.
since the month of october, a clear signed for of the care palliative, as the dr stated and the dr archibald, everything for demonstrate their opposition to such initiative.
according the lon., the system health of quebec not is what enough responsible as for ensure that who have right to care palliative of quality before of that is accept proceed with the euthanasia.

the lon. believes that a 90% of the people that dropped die grateful to their carers that not them have with in their demands a time is them has ever their pain thank to a team of care palliative.
but there that say that the care palliative not are absolutely in what that as the treatment the pain.
according, director of the care palliative to home of cardiff, the patients not they to the treatments against the pain in a 8% of the cases.
the end of the life, the doctors usually resort to the sedating palliative, that it for eye the patient to the at of their haemorrhaging, already be of in occupational or of in permanent.
not we pretend that not we that part the suffering.
every time more, the disease not ludford is to have the possibility of have that sedating palliative.

this season has on a new entity with the.
? how behind that breakthrough?
is could explain for a decision-making of awareness individual, but also for the new dimension the.
have come large players.
of day in day to their on.
the personal technical also i has great a.
and these elements i same to daily to raise the level of my at.
in a party, that is more easy.
all is very quickly in the football.
but i not i.
since my at in the centre of of to my step for, always i progress to steps leaps.
is to obtain benefit of the competition for carlo.
the recruitment of this summer are used to also parties of very high level.
know that every numbers is crucial.
that ago that a player as i have to of fight and take all.
for other part, carlo i provided a in as to my enabled.
is supported for deputy as claude, that in the same position that i.
? is the man that needed the team?
for course.
have respect to all the technical.
today for today, not there nobody as in the league 1 and is between the best european.
has a great experience and has cattle many titles with the best clubs.
has worked with large players.
i that is will other titles in paris.
in january i a conversation very comforting with he.
i had of out of a series of injury.
the confidence that has in me it also my good performance.
? what think on the in the first part of the season?
in the league 1, lyon we has taken the since of leader.
but we in the ambush.
one of our are objectives is the league of champions: we we life-saving for the of end with lifestyle.
? what is the aim the club in this competition?
we to treat of to what more far possible.
to from of now, can to any thing.
but we a that say with to many and very good equipment european.
we, for start, end the first of our league with the oporto for power receive the back of of end.
? the can become in a great club european to short long-term?
already has the budget ...
for become in a great club european, paris has that win titles and be there to long long-term.
today for today, that not is the case.
to level economic, the is given to their media for that that project is never.
not win the cup in the league 1, as in the last season,? would a great failure?
for course, would a great disappointment.
this year we to invest all our efforts in us that title of champions.
in the last season not we far.
in may we have a disappointment, already that had with the conditions a for; first.
had a season strong.
things with 79 points.
normally, with 79 points should have been champions ...
but another team, the, had a season quite better.
this year i that will the good.
even if the large equipment as the marseille, the lyon and the bordeaux fighting for the title, i that we with the weapons for.
? believes that the media expect more the?
is normal that be a of us if we in what that is has made in the players that we.
what we accepted completely.
after of that in home to, that still is are with things that blame is a little frustrating.
we ask what more expected the people.
never we win all the for of week.
! not we the shout barcelona!
we of to in into a project of at.
a team is build with time.
in the league of champions we shown that we respond and be present.
! look the manchester holder that, after two ignores, not has achieved into for of end, and them also have made great!
in view of the sums alas, you with 15 points of advantage to the apos.
that would allow to our adversaries and the championship of france.
lyon and marseille, that not were well the season previous, is have seen&&; powered&&; for this new.
that shows that the league 1 is prevent.
i that in may we say with a concerning that, to despite of all the difficulties, we over the prize.
the seems completely dependent of the successes of you you.
better that say that we a&&;&&;.
that to say that you is very responsible and that bottom many goals.
has come for demonstrate that is the star of the league 1.
and has shown in all the equipment for the that has last that is a great player, a star world.
in the group we the man and the player.
and he also respects to the men that has to their around.
what that has fact is truly exceptional.
that prompts to the others to increase their level of at.
da, one of the best defenders the world, allows also that all move.
? how olivier through the football 2012 with the team of france?
has been a disappointment.
was very happy for participate in this football.
unfortunately, my minor i was earned time of at.
i things there and i reinforced.
today achievement around good parties in the selection.
is what that than since my baptism with the&&; blues&&;.
learn the lesson of what that happened in ukraine and to this is must that today we a behaviour exemplary.
? what vision you the first month of the with of the&&; blues&&;?
is moving results.
are well located in the group of classification for the world.
the is had, have to the players and have to win.
as was the case of laurent mont-blanc.
but not i to comparisons.
mont-blanc in their aim of for the football.
i that carried to the selection to brazil.
? the score() the 16 of october in spain was for lay the foundations?
that at we was confidence.
every one for all.
before of that shock in spain, not had through a at apos in all my career.

the prices the, after have come to the top of 30 dollars( 23 eur) in june of 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months more later, before of again today to back the ten dollars( the contributions is in the indeed).
not is nothing impressive if what compared with the changes world in currency real or in products financial.
, however, the bank central european( ecb) is was for he in a report on the coins online published in october.
in he, is described the as&&; the currency virtual with more success&&;,&&; that disappear with the dollar or the euro&&; and&&; similar to the coins conventional&&;.
is difference of other systems with types of coins online as the&&; appropriations&&;, used for move in a and that is can win playing or is can buy( and even in times).
the network social facebook developed also this kind of system.
but in all exchange a authority central controls and is the changes.
with the, all the nodes of network are to the time trustees of books of accounting, verifiers, on of currency and buyers and sellers.
? how works that network?
every compromise between two users is ago in reality between two directions electronic in in of e-mail electronic.
a user can choose a direction different for every payment, thus so the pushers.
a whole of information compounded to this compromise is signing electronically to through of a system of have to double key.
the network can so verify the authenticity of the compromise.
thank the content the mens, is also possible ensure that the changes of will in the book of accounts public, that is you for all the network.
the milestone key is in write that new compromise in that book.
this is for the resolution of a challenge have it to the computers and the winner, a kind of banker central provisional, will the privileged of add that line supplementary.
is is of a stage of of mens, is say, of transformation of a great mens in a left numerical more shorter and only.
the computers&&; you&&; the new compromise and in a number before of&&;&&; the whole.
the aim is find the number that will a left particular( more talk the principle).
a time that is is that number, the other nodes easily that is the good.
the compromise is is then people to the chain of joint of the other transactions; all change replaced the left.
if, for commit a fraud, a user i pay two sometimes with the same money very quickly( in least of ten minutes), the network only accept as valid a of the two transactions; the other is would, already that both have fingerprinting different.
the computer that opportunity the challenge is for 50.
for avoid the inflation, that to is into in two regularly, with likelihood before the end of 2012.
the number of in movement is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but are divisible to the, what that is a for broader.
the difficulty of this challenge is reveals also in every increase of the power of calculation.
the life of the network has already their ups.
the websites website that offered services for have been attacked and is have stolen in by.
&&; the failure used not affects the same protocol&&;, will pierre, that has of launch, a company of payment in currency real that used the network.
the ecb has in account also the for of of money thank to this service fundamentally.
but the money in effective is the same fault.
the players of weight as one reject the payments of this kind.
other, as the platform, the accepted.
recently, accuses and rum, the in israel, carried the book of accounting and were that close the 80% of not everything.
in november is were the&&; cheap giants&&;.
&&; is changed 30,000 dollars&&;, is, that working for, that becomes the in gold.
pierre, author of a book locked on that currency, believes quite in the potential of this technology also of in the network of transactions.
their system,, is to a card of credit( in currency real) or to a payment for mobile, contact, but used for validate the transactions, that so out more cheap.
the her, also, managed their identity and can, for therefore, remain in the pushers.
the system is easy of to in into in the shops, that not have that; new terminals not.
them enough with supply a direction that a telephone can&&; and recognise&&;, precise pierre, that will have thousands of users.
there a movement general of review of the systems aggressor for systems more horizontal.
&&; will lack a time for that is will, but in 2013 could have a change&&;,.
for other part, in their report the ecb for enhance the risks various, today who higher, in case of that this currency have success.

a constitution with in egypt
is a new double or nothing the president followed.
while that egypt is more divided that never in as to the declaration constitutional, that you make provisionally powers a, he decided around the all for the all.
by to all the world for surprise the wednesday, when announced that the house assembly would their text end the day next.
ago so only a week, the head of state had given two months more to this house for end their jobs.
and ago almost two years that egypt used a text provisional, several sometimes amended, what that apos the stability institutional and for to judicial.
this new initiative not has fact more that increase the speaking in the country.
for their opponents, the president ethical in their&&; step&&; and continues&&; convenient their word&&; and&&; trampling the right&&;.
for part of their supporters, is will that is is of a measure for end more quickly with the crisis institutional and policy and speed the process of transition.
in the next 15 days should, a referendum.
a time of time very short that forced to the brothers to up to their project of explain the text, article for article, to the egyptians.
for the president, is is also of a in of to a being popular and democratic while the and cause havoc in all the country.
followed seems convinced of that the egyptians will to their favour, as stated in a interview the puts american time.
recital that that appeal is has voted with many quickly, contains a an for the people egyptian:&&; or vote my text or i the powers a&&;, powers that supposed that to their end with the adoption of the constitution.
is in that environment strange in the that 85 member of this house assembly, islamist in their great majority, voted the text yesterday.
the majority of the liberals not turned to the call.
to middle of november, a little before of the declaration constitutional, had closed the door because considered that not could to assert their points of view.
the representatives of the rights human, the minorities religious and of the society civil did what same.
to end of that is reached the quorum necessary, yesterday for the morning is manner to 11 people, member substitutes, to all haste.
some of them are very those to the brothers muslims.
as expected wait, the articles highly-qualified what have been for unanimity.
to the commentators them ago grace, for other part, the fact of that a of the few discrepancies of the apos is has expressed virtually to the time of the sentence, therefore is so that several member the committee came to think that the clock of the assembly was is.
the text, that yesterday later was still being voted, certain of ludicrous articles.
the article 2, subject of all the expectations, still being finally same the of the constitution of 1971, that wagon that&&; the principles of the sharia are the source main the right&&;.
the parties, for who the establishment of the law islamic is a vindication fundamental, expecting that is so replace&&; the principles&&; for&&; the rules&&;, what that would allowed a implementation more strict.
for the islamists, that this article not has been amended is a guarantee of their good will and of their respect towards the other components of the society egyptian.
the liberals what of hypocrisy and they that not is is more that of a sleight advertising.
according them, the islam of the constitution is ago to through of other articles.
is are, in special, the article 220, that which to the university a role advisory, in particular for all at that has of confirm their accordance with the laws of the sharia.
according the specialist in egypt sophie, is disturbing because&&; the people so-called to decision not is is and not has no legitimacy democratic.
here detect the premises of a theocracy&&;.
the fears of the liberals is are also increased for the fact of that the next rector of this university would quite least moderate that the current.
&&; for now, not there a involvement religious concrete.
with this constitution we in the framework the state civil.
the majority of the lawyers that have working in that text not are counter but it, some of them educated in the system french&&;, it, that for a a on the transition constitutional egyptian.
but recognised that can have certain ambiguity in about the article 220, therefore the terms employees the vocabulary religious.
&&; we talking in particular the term& at at; justice islamic,& at the;.
and the question that could be in the future would in what measure are the judges civil competent for decision for above of all this&&;.
more beyond of their nature religious, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that is are to the powers prize that which the president of the republic.
the brothers muslims that are few in compared with the that were for the previous regime.
another point contention: the powers conferred the army.
with the i of the military, the review the budget of defence not will subject the parliament, but to a council national of defence.
not is will the from of civil in courts military, as protestors the associations for the defence of the rights human.
these also were their concerns relating the text, that they was.
the crime of blasphemy is in and, of now in forward, the insults are prohibited, what that could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression, on all the of the press.
also, no article emphasises the protection of the women,,, of human human watch.
according she, what only positive has been the ban of the torture of agreement with the article 36.
the word not one in the constitution previous.
although the president egyptian should out yesterday for the night in the television, is out demonstrations for this at.
the supporters the head of state is signals the saturday.

&&; the large and powerful&&; you will to moscow: immigrants save for the language
while members and defenders of the rights human is on the consequences that bring the law on the examination compulsory, already have appeared in the country dealers that in with certified&&; counterfeit&&;
every year, 13 million of workers immigrants they to moscow, st petersburg and other cities of russia.
in their majority are citizens of countries of asia central: uzbekistan, tajikistan and turkmenistan.
their only aim is win money for help to their families that is have been in home.
since the 1 of december will in force a law, according the which every immigrant labour must to a examination for check their knowledge of the language russian.
for now, this rule is applies only for those that have the intention of work in the sector of provision of services, institutions of services community, services domestic and trade the for will.
, however, with the time, as promise in the service federal of immigration, the examinations is will obligatory for all the immigrants.
also, not will enough with holding the examination of the language, if not also the of history russian and the of foundations of the legislation.
the knowledge of the language is must confirm even for receive and renew the permit of work.
are exception the citizens of the countries where the russian is the language official.
not will subject to this law the people that started obtain their certified of education and qualifications before of the dissolution of the union soviet in 1991.
usefulness, growing and defence of the rights
the network of centres harmonised will under for the institute of language russian, the university of the friendship of the people, the university state of moscow, the university state of st petersburg and other institutions of education higher russian.
the immigrants will stand to the evidence in all the cities, now same in russia are open more of 160 centres of this kind.
the initiative on the introduction the examination was supported for the members of the duma state and for the service federal of immigration.
but the defenders of the rights, a before of that the law by in force, started many sometimes to this question to the press:? and what will this in reality?
? what changes bring the nature the knowledge of the language, therefore for the russians as for the own immigrants?
in first place, they the representatives the service of immigration, this will reduce the number of people that suffer&&; slavery labour&&;.
many people about today on the defence of the rights of the immigrants labour, it single, head of the representation the service federal of immigration of russia in tajikistan.
the defence of their rights must shot before of their starting.
only a system of selection organised will resolve the problem of the workers immigrants in a 90% of the cases.
the problems the have the immigrants, profession, education, the that not know the language not spend the control doctor.
, the understanding of the language, says, the future immigrant is be condemned to find people, unscrupulous that, with the pretext of help, you please a&&; paid&&; to a infants and close, where he and dozens of other as he is that for months, food not documents, working of 12 to 14 hours the day.
we a explanations of complaints of our immigrants.
&&; in their homeland them promise a thing, but the to are deceived, is them deprived of their passports, not them paid the wages desperately&&;, confirms the head of the direction of immigration labour the service of immigration of tajikistan, wrote.
! not is,!
, however, while therefore many citizens of the republics of asia central that want work in russia recognise that not only not know the language the country the that to go, but that also in their language own write with difficulty.
for course, this not is therefore their fault but their own unfortunately: are few the xinjiang,, that can be the luxury of receive education primary normal.
this is must to that their families even not have nothing that to of feed to the children, for not about already of, and what necessary for the school.
the to to the adolescence, these boys is safeguarded to work to the first opportunity.
is difficult, if not is know the language, recognise them.
&&; one is feel behind and than&&;.
, however, in what that is as to the law on the language, the defenders of the rights guarding a point important.
the examinations is will to out only for those immigrants whose status be legal.
if not have that status, not will not examination and, in result, no work official.
while therefore, the majority of the workers immigrants are living in russia illegally.
&&; welcome or ban the step to meet&&;
many visitors by that receive the status official in our country not is so easy.
the cause is in the obstacles bureaucratic and in the difficulties of the language in yes.
also, the legalisation costs money: of twelve billion to sixteen billion.
, however, a for false is can to quickly and for only billion over.
the employees of the police russian know that generally have documents counterfeit, not we registered and officer the cases of extortion.
&&; we they hundred or 10 for cigarette or teaspoons&&;, a to the journalists the citizen of tajikistan,.
&&; we, not do, buying a paint&&;
the first day of the entry in force of the law on the language, is it of clear that not only the documents of registration of immigrants can be counterfeit.
several certified&&; counterfeit&&; of knowledge of the language already have been concerning for officials the service federal of immigration.
the documents counterfeit had been; in standard of colour.
for course, came to the hands of the new owners not as gift: every immigrant, facilitate the task of to the evidence, paid for the document seven billion.
this is two sometimes and a more expensive that the procedure official of examination, that cost the worker immigrant three billion.
the main task for a future next is protect the system against the corruption for that the&&; qualifications&&; not is can buy, the officials the government and the defenders of the rights.
to the at, the authorities can promised to the workers immigrants that not would been to with success the examination the first time more time for to the course basic of the language.
also, to the immigrants that not speak russian is them membership jobs that not require communication active with the people.

is are in strike the employees of restaurants of food fast and supermarkets in us.
to a quarter part of adolescents americans are their first jobs as cash in&&; mcdonald& apos; s&&;
in the last days, in the states united is has on a you of protests against the netherlands wages that is paid in the supermarkets of the s and in restaurants of the popular chains of food fast, such as&&; mcdonald& apos; s&&;,&&; mcdonald king&&;,&&;&&;,&&;& apos; s&&; and&&;&&;.
for now nobody is if to count if will or not this you to the nine points, or if has aimed lose forces and in their first stages.
the actions of protest have with the support of the trade and of a series of ngos of left.
also the increase of the modest wages contemplate for the workers of and the the system of food fast, the aim of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade of workers in these companies.
for now, this sector of the economy virtually not has been occupied for the movement trade.
? forty and six cents the year?
the actions started the week last, after the day of action of thank, the called&&; friday black&&;. that day, in states united the orgy of cheap that pelagics to million of inhabitants, and that to sometimes was accompanied of clashes.
that day, some workers of the s, that as to 2.2 million of people in the world, abandoned their jobs of work and guards of protest together to the trade and activists of left in the shops of the s, whose products is encounter to people of income modest and moderates.
sold of all, since, revolvers of hunting and batteries for cars, to, eggs and milk.
the products in their shops are of average between a 8% and a 27% more cheaper that the of the supermarkets more large.
is for that that many workers is paid of buy only in the work.
the availability and the had of products have fact of a of the corporations more large of america.
according the words two critical, can afford the luxury of sell products to very under price, in part because paid little to their workers.
these last also is complain of the poor conditions labour, such as the lack of or so-called of hand.
that&&; friday black&&; the participants of the demonstration disproportionate the increase of wages and is complained of that the cost the sure of health provided for the s happened of 30 to 100 dollars month.
for a worker typical of, that a dollars for time, this expenditure is excessive, said.
scientists of the university of california in argue that if is the wage a to 12 for time, this you cost to the s 3.2 billion of dollars.
this is approximately a 1.1% more of what that spent in wages now.
if put the increase wage in the shoulders of the consumers, every visit to the shop them will only 46 cents more expensive.
in a year them will the ridiculous amount of dollars more of what that on now.
the supporters of lot satisfied that the protest had place so only in nine states and that not killed no loss to the s.
the&&; friday black&&; is prolonged in their shops since the 8 of the later the thursday to the midnight the day next and, for that time, marketed around of horrendous articles for second.
in total, their boxes street post-election the&&; friday black&&; almost 100 million of transactions.
the representative of the company, are, declared in a interview the get website of left post, that was their since of work&&; least of five&&; employees of and that the protest not had been more that&&; another trick of relations public&&;, organised for the; of workers.
&&;! box free!&&;
the protests continued this week in new york, in the that the objectives not were precisely the large stores( that in this progressive city not them have hold, and for that for now not there none), but the&&; mcdonald& apos; s&&; and other restaurants cheaper.
! mcdonald& apos; s says that sold thousands of million of over, and then not even you volvo the low for disease and not you paid for your work honest!
williams, member the council municipal of new york
currently, of agreement with the law federal and the of new york, the wage minimum is of for time.
the restaurants of food fast what will increasing with the time, but only slightly, and of average, the workers ordinary receive in new york dollars for time.
nobody earns least that them in this city.
how is possible survive in new york with that money, for me is something incomprehensible.
there a time when almost the quarter part of the adolescents americans experience for the mcdonald& apos; s and worked there, behind of the desks, to time- after of the school, although still living with their parents.
few were the that his this as the main source of income or stay there a time.
now, constantly in some interviews with workers of mcdonald& apos; s that is complain of that have that live of this wage, and to sometimes even which to their children.
for another on, in a forum of the magazine wall street journal there a comment whose author out that is irresponsible have children if not know with what them of feed.
the participants in the protests, that started to the 6: 30 of the morning the thursday in the mcdonald& apos; s of the street and, disproportionate that to the cash and saying of food fast is them start to pay for what least 15 for time, or be, that is them double their wage minimum current.
also disproportionate that in the sector of the food fast is believe trade of workers.
the law of the us. from to the administration restrict this right and punish to the activists the movement trade with wanting and redundancies.
for other part, rarely time the administration them facilitates the life.
but, for reasons objective, is easy that the trade the sector of food.
a of the main is the excessive rotating the personal.

protests had place that same day in other restaurants cheaper of manhattan.
the culmination of the action had place to half the rally in the mcdonald& apos; s it close of times square, in the that took several political democrats local, in particular the member the council municipal of the city williams, that said:&&; mcdonald& apos; s says that is markets thousands of million of over, and then not even you of a hospital not you paid for your work honest&&;.
the demonstrators received the support of other leading democrats of new york, for example the candidate to mayor of the city garage of, that said that&&; we support to the workers the sector of food fast for that overriding receive wages fair and the prosperity economic that is deserves every&&;.
as what described the newspaper new york times, this has been the greater demonstration of this kind in the history american of the food fast.
but in she took only a few hundreds of people, even not all them were employees the service of food fast, in the that tens of thousands of people of new york.
still not is clear if this will of lit for to a movement mass.
&&; for now, is the brain not is so easy&&;
the issue of the reality increase, so popular between the sports to the technologies modern, recently is can with as mainly to through the prism of glasses special.
to beginning the summer, in their conference annual google proved a model in movement and subsequently, in november, is it that microsoft had have also a request for risk the which patent.
, however, of a conversation with the head the group of technology interactive at in the laboratory of microsoft of cambridge,, is that for the scientists of this company, the glasses already been to a stage last.
to them them attracts the perspective of the manipulation of these online in the air with the hands naked and the creation of areas online open.
- for favour, in terms general,? what is the subject of study of their group of research?
- we we to the interaction, but also we of of the limits of this interaction.
for now the humanity in their great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the of the screen flat, to sometimes the is with the finger.
but us we look years forward and speakers the changes winds in this interaction.
for example, the days and the sensors represent a step forward and today in day no is sold,, already that to all them interested the control for gestures.
-? what more we be the future?
- to despite of that has taken the interaction the level physical, great part of this still happens in a screen flat, to sometimes in at.
the introduction of information has just( the system a more data), and the exit still not is very good.
we trying of change this, we in systems of viewing truly, based in different technologies, including the of design.
is must release the world of the it the our, the physical, do more tangible.
for this,, however, is necessary recognise not only the user, but also the space that what are.
then we complete the world real with these online of a in more comfortable.
in first place,! the massive with these his helmets of reality virtual!
-? what think you on the control for voice?
a detail very popular, but? not believes that what?
- clear that not is you can be a panacea, is outstanding of resolve the question of privacy, already that not always is to that the others is through of our actions and intentions.
of fact, all the types of interaction with adequate are good, but every one in their own field.
for example, for the control of equipment in places public, we a project in the that we in the gestures, but not in movements loose, but more short.
also, the gestures were every not for the house the has, but for a is that 4.5 the movement of the bones and the muscle.
for now is very large, but in theory can be small the size of a clock of is.
but, in general, the future is for a kind combined of control, for example of gesture r voice.
-? how is that?
- for example,? how i would you that you ask this saying of?
you shall and the bring the same time.
- normally i only i.
- oh, that is to be very difficult of recognise.
-? or be, you to they to the users to adapt to what that can or not can to in this at the machine?
- not necessarily, but is a rapprochement mutual.
i that in a future next we to have that work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can determine with precision the reactions of the person.
these can be, for example, sensors infrared, already that provide a good resolution in depth, what that is very important.
- if we of their work with the sensors of,? what complaints has you of the chambers modern?
? them lack resolution, depth or something more?
- in principle, the generation current is what that can be the start of our work with the recognition.
for course, would good obtain 8 to the at of 1.
but the question not is in the, but in the quality of the parent and in the depth.
since this last point of view, all the technologies current not are what enough good for us; this of more work to the designers of.
or be, that we that remember not only the resolution in the important x and and, but also in.
also is important the at, the number of tables for second.
the movements human are quite enjoy and the current of 30 are truly scarce, on all for the gestures.
, of our laboratory in, was a 0.40 of contact with of a of 1 to 100 and is mention that the modern sensors who in series are more close the second value().
not all the world understand in what measure this affects to the interaction.
to me i would very useful for my work a equivalent of such has, but that not take contact for that the tables for second are more.
-? and not is necessary increase the number of chambers?
- the has now three&&; chambers&&;, a of the which is of fact the issuer-pays of rays infrared and the second the recipient of the signal has.
but the third house is in reality a simple 0.40 the visible.
this not is used for determine the depth the subject.
potentially, more amount of chambers could resolve the problem ...
or the contrary, increased and fundamental the amount required of are.
would good create a prove flexible of, around with the curvature of location of the chambers and see how this help to the position.
- for what that i i, microsoft, to difference of google, not has have their glasses the public.
? not you seems that, since the point of view the use daily of technologies of reality increase, the glasses are a of the platforms more we?
- for course, to all the pink sustainable in high a telephone intelligent in the hands, not is very comfortable, but i i: the better option would a reality increase&&;&&; when, in basis of a platform of cloud, you could to of the glasses the telephone intelligent,
the glasses are equipment very personal, in that is their force( the things private only you will them), but also their weakness: a reality increase based in glasses not you will work on these online together with other people.
- imagine for a at that the manipulation of these online in the air is available not only for tony of the film&&;&&;, but also for any simple deadly.
there a problem in this idea that the critical usually out:! not there answer!
! the hands not feel nothing!
? what answers for their group for this challenge?
- in my conferences to often i that the reality increase is the seventh just in the interaction between the man and the machine.
i that the eighth well could be the addition of sensations.
while therefore, one of the noticed more interesting is the use of the second hand in quality of aid for the image.
! with the you perfectly!
but there also technologies that are truly win to to to these&&; images in the air&&;. for example, the interference of several rays targeted to a point specific where is is the finger of a that similar to the that one feel if someone as in the of the it, but that that still is very weak.
there also for the jailer that on in the of the it, this also a direction promising.
-? has treaty of is the brain?
? to think that he feel what that seems that should feel in the at in that is something?
- that is a good idea, still not what we tried.
here is behind another challenge with the that we that fight for a time, how to that a person physically within in a space very small creates that is to a space open, almost, end. we working also in the idea of the we of can( not as the of the generally), platforms mobile, so as the of the much giants.
for now, is the brain not is so easy, still there that work for many years.
that is what that ago attractive the work with the reality virtual for the researchers, that many things is are in a state of total view.
will personal policing in place of culture-
&&;&&; continues the project&&; of st petersburg&&;, into to the citizens that is are front, to the forefront the art and of the culture.
in this list of the best is are it figures the art and the scene of st petersburg, whose achievements they more beyond of the city: to often are recognition in europe, that russia the knows even.
the new hero of&&;&&; is the artist miller.
all the city known to miller, a man clothing of red of down collapsed, the that is can find close the museum russian, close the garden of summer or in meetings of fashionable and.
the tables of miller always by to, where wants that is desks.
miller is one of these purely of st petersburg, are of new.
miller is a brilliant representative the of st petersburg of end of the 80- principles of the 90.
also, is a man urban, whose emergence in the streets of the city meeting in the inhabitants greeted and comments to all the state of that.
recently, took in their hands a and is became in the of st petersburg, already that has grown for to so difficult role, for their existence bohemia, their philosophy and their image.
-,? for what you for the city clothing of red and not of hindu or, for example?
- the colour red because i designer of fashionable and i am to the about and to the image.
in this world, the colour red is a compromise between the artist, the are of images and the society.
although in the society, all what that not be a little grey for degree and use of properties nothing good.
but my simplified are; to that is significant a conversation.
all the history of my actions are a invitation the debate.
-? when that be artist?
- in a statement the palacio of culture, where is paraded my jobs.
i realised account of that that was my way.
then the wave of old artists not official had over, and the new, free as i, were still.
i i friend of artists of the new you, with the further to the that is were in gaza and, that was to&&;&&;, and already is over the new you.
i in the theatre for the clothes, the music of all the are, but not for the actually.
- and all this is in your clinic of art ...- for me was important certainly in the centre cultural of st petersburg, where is be together the best minds creative.
in 1995, previously a territory in and there, while not had reforms, broad a club passage musical, a club karlsbad, the home of the bohemia of st petersburg.
many born there:, about, i the way in that brought the project to&&; the eartag of will associated&&;.
and their friends songs small under, trousers anyway, between them was the currently composer of fashionable grodno.
when the group started to play in live, is became in&&;&&;.
was of many programmes before of the times of.
them we to and was the start of their great career; the education basic and training the received of us.
gallery&&; d 137&&;, the&&; club, are the remains of the clinic the art.
there would our employees and customers widely.
i a hero the century last, when the culture mean something.
in the year 2000, the survey is was in the press, the prize was&&; the people of our city&&;.
in the nomination&&; artist the year&&; i elected i, so end my culmination.
in these new times not is comfortable work; i i a man the that you like the truth, the honesty and the culture the century last.
in our times is easy done popular, but the culture and the popularity will separate. one can be popular but very little religious.
- there in your jobs something recognisable.
- many of my on are, in them is this clearly the today and the commonplace.
i to to a statement agenda,&&; the museum russian in buffoons&&;.
the buffoons are a category speech.
i before was her, but now be so is painful and other.
but in the buffoons all is and the tragedy is would.
i love what grotesque, i ideas grotesque.
for example, the for the world by a change totalitarian and compulsory of clothes.
now to one what are for the clothes, in what external, but not in the internal of the person.
and, such time to that person not is you should not to the hand, but in the face.
and the deception is will when is changes of clothes.
- ago little you we in the role of urban.- a city must have a hero so.
! who better that i for become!
- well but,? to what better the art trade can be saying?
- now the art trade must be careful, fresh, have you.
we being witnessing of the disintegration of the cultures.
before the people is in some, the wanted a thing, the other.
now all is have divided in, is difficult please to all.
not i a ticket of hundred dollars for- to all.
now there that think to who your tass.
now, every hero of religious has their 100 fan.
-! and for listen to they for thousands!
- will to it the devotes, there works the sphere.
and to a event cultural will 300 people, 10 billion never come. as result, least management, least money, all is.
i to my fan, what more important is not deceive, not it to lose what that olivier achieved.
when was young was such tables that a the your in the wall the on of and.
i started with on, with the that for what general the people stops.
now to often who the concepts.
say culture spiritual, culture of consumption.
not there no culture in the consumption, that is other history.
i i a man of the culture of yesterday, under the example of artists that living in the poverty and died in the poverty, is obstruct the money only for paint tables.
i i to favour of this culture.
-,? what is what that you lack to st petersburg?
- good experts in culture.
there a concept: official of the culture.
but not all them can their to the culture.
when the on were the right all was of other way, the on such time not seaports very well the culture, but they that was necessary keep to the experts right.
in moscow now there very good consultants.
we people in st petersburg that well could be experts, but are closed, because is need experts to a level higher that nevertheless, to they and them open way.
now is the will personal policing.
what same, but the difference is that them say honestly that not all the art modern is accepted, there some artists that have that to other museums.
-? what is for you st petersburg?
- st petersburg not is a capital cultural. in moscow there many more culture, there there ground.
but on our stones is difficult that the art;.
need ground cultural and we now more writers that readers, this is is.
in europe there a lot of people with curious that is to holiday and concerts.
in our case, this class is tiny.
we that to that the art is of fashionable, as what was to at the century last.
the project is implemented with a subsidy of st petersburg.
to to light in the space
the land is in danger.
warming global or clash with a asteroid murderer.
tailbacks of malta-registered space with human to board proceed in for of a planet of spare.
for keep the humanity is ago the question main:? how continue the kind in conditions of out or in the same planet of spare?
i that there little where choose.
of fact, only two are real planets that can be hung, the least.
&&; these are venus and mars&&;, says the scientists head the institute alleged state,.(), vladimir.
but if the conditions in mars are best for the life, in the surface of venus the temperature is of 500 degrees.
only is can live to large or in the from of venus ... in the space.
is started to address the problems of reproduction in the space with the flora.
ago already a century that is were to out experiments with plants.
four generations of peas in from not is differed in nothing of the varieties overland.
after wine the rearing of insects in the from, small nut of the fruit, the.
in 1979 is submitted the space eggs of for check how is develops the embryo in conditions of out.
helps as result a normal.
but then start the problems.
&&; the problem is in that this has that find support, must is on their own feet and start to!&&;, it vladimir, the director the laboratory the institute of problems() of the academy of sciences of russia.
the not find support, the by the gambling.
and after of 10 hours in the would babies is was a total of the prompts.
the not react to the light not the audio.
and the unfortunately was that the out of four days simply is died.
&&; and two sometimes we that born the, but then what stop because was impossible work there with them&&;,, observing vladimir on failure the experiment with the in the space.
the last time that a&&;&&; biological did to the from was ago 16 years.
in the spring the 2013 continue the experiments.
, however, in the&&;&&; only travel species of a same sex.
there a experiment with repeat, that were settlement the space already with foetuses.
in principle, not is found nothing.
&&; this was precisely in the, but this was a experiment only, and studies as this must be to out&&;, observing vladimir.
after the landing, the repeat space had offspring.
, however, still not is has managed address the problem of the reproduction directly in the space.
is a challenge difficult.
the animals, the lose their habitat her, simply not can to their your sexual.
the man,, however, to difference of the small animals, in principle, can.
the has the reasoning abstract and is capable of create a fund emotional appropriate.
experiments similar not is have to out for reasons ethical.
but the women travel the space since ago already 50 years.
the greater risk what happened.
and what more precious that has the humanity is the body female.
our fly, and nobody in the land could say: if is after of a flight the space.
will or not have a baby after of this flight.
&&; after of all, to this question nobody has would&&;, observing the off the sector aerospace.
in june of 1964, only after of a year the flight the space, the first woman,, was to light to a daughter.
the father of the girl,, was also.
in 1988, the second woman, zavadskaya, who two sometimes was in from and even worked in the space open, had a son.
, however, the risk there.
we few, are wall the astronauts to who after of long flights all them has result well, and a generation healthy next growing.
&&; and if is can say more, is dangerous even in flights&&;, sums the pilot, hero of the union soviet, hero of russia,.
, however, the humanity must to some new to in the biotechnology, in the protection radiation, in the creation of the serious artificial.
the the centre of preparation of is a stage compulsory in the preparation for the flight.
in conditions of would, the close their skills of work in the space.
the water the out.
if for a adult the water is a environment comfortable, although still hostile, for a child would born is their element home.
the small seem confirm that the life in the land about the ocean.
there a connection between the fact of that the baby is- approximately 9 months within of their mother in the tanks, therefore you will more easy used then the water.
in principle, this is logical, because since the at the birth to the at the first it spend only 2 weeks.
&&; this is very little for forget something&&;, says marina, of swimming of would babies.
in short, if the out is a state more natural for a would born, for the women is necessary the, the force of the serious.
in the out the muscle and of the is very quickly, the capacity of expulsion the apos is reduces.
good, that, by in the action of revival for the childbirth.
is can, for course, to to light in a house special, this what.
&&;? and then what?&&;, is ago this original question.
for other part, the child also needs serious artificial.
, the that of serious, the body not generated the skeleton not the system jugular.
to a would born in from is impossible with a suit special for, as to the adults.
simply is you time of what that is vital for he.
&&; and this experiment that we to to together, the allow the birth of a child in a environment strange, will place to that to the land to a disabled, to a person completely suit&&;, for the head the committee of bioethics-related the institute of problems of the academy of sciences of russia, grodno.
for now, the birth of children in the space is a question theoretical.
, however, with the time this will a reality, when the beings human in their malta-registered is associated to a planet ago that will the home for their children babies in the space.
head of: the inspection the system&&;&&; not has given with the political guilty
in on of tenders public, the republic czech account with good inspectors and a legislation of quality, although their implementation.
so what says miloslav, vice-president of the office of control by() in a interview for.
&&; the law never will perfect&&;, but their implementation must be right.&&; this is, in my opinion, what that we lack&&;, so describes the situation current.
the controls joint of the inspectors czech and germans also they to conclusions similar.
as example of a practice wrong,; the attitude of towards the system of be be only on the role, that is known as the system&&;&&;.
the first minister said recently that the ods( party democratic civic) not to the employers with inspectors. then,? is ban or allowed?
&&; the law must be favour of some way and if from something, in that case, not the president the government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls not demand obligations&&;, complaints.
in the meeting of the commission of control in the congress of the members,. spoke the project common between the team czech and the german, in the framework the which is bosnian the legislation which to the tenders public in both countries.
? what is exactly?
is is of a control parallel that are to to ago a two years.
said of way it: the legislation european how is must organise the tenders public, to this you still the legislation to in every country and, after, the these in yes.
us what we uk all and, although the control still not has complete, we obtained differences very interesting. generally, the legislation of our country is&&; more strict and more full&&;,, however, the these concrete in some parameters is better in germany.
is confirms, therefore, that not enough with integrate rules every time more stricter, but that is necessary focus in the implementation of the law same.
? what can to of fact this project?? what believes that are the conclusions?
precisely a control common of this kind could make to that we of invest efforts in the that of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, although this not have a impact so positive.
the economy the savings means to a thing appropriate to a price reasonable( what that not always means that the price be the more under) for avoid so the enrichment and, to the long, the actions criminal.
but not for the fact of reduce the limit of the tenders to say that we to this.
perhaps because the system is surplus with therefore&&; tape&&;, that those that want to failures in the system will do more easily that if the limits is maintained so higher as now.
. about of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the of the tenders public.
? how works the system of controls in germany?
? is a office analogous to our or is quot of other way?
in how to the offices, as the, there it the( court federal of accounts), with a organisation similar to the our, with a school also, what only is that in their case is structured of a way a therefore different, but in principle both offices evolve parallel.
also the powers are to true point,, however, in therefore that germany has a organisation federal, the courts of accounts is are even to this level. in this aspect from slightly of our system.
the court federal of accounts() only can control the money federal, what that here we funds state.
the funds public, that are administered for the regions and the municipalities, there, in germany, is monitored in the court federal of accounts.
in as to the legislation local,? is more simple that the our?
for what general, not i like establish a compared, data specific. not however, germany still being a model in some aspects, but not is can must with what in what is better.
? could be better, for example, in as to the quality of the inspectors?
that sure that not, but, i, not i like to this kind of comparisons.
is necessary say that even those countries that we as model must to with to a great number of problems.
if not outside so, not them contribute no benefit cooperate with our office,? not believes?
in as to the legislation of our country,? what meant for their office the amendment of law on the tenders public?? is to of some way their impact?
taking in account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, still not is has said in the actions of control.
given that time controls former post, is be have with a true delay.
for now, is is in the process of preparation of the controls future: we on a new tool of&&; detection of risks not economic&&;, for the that we fact to almost nearby tenders public, that have been considered. the changes is will perfectly about here, already that is modify the limits, is the conditions of some types the process of selection and similar.
? as that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that, more well, is a large for the system bureaucratic?
i that this law is surely a step in the direction right and i that so be.
the problem that can emerge is that the regulation&&; is glad&&; and that be impossible must.
already with the regulation previous, the people controlled were linked the contractor( for example, in the case of the programmes operational regional the council regional), and every law not respected in on of tenders public mean the violation of the discipline budgetary.
? has sense then tighten the law of this way?
i that not of this way.
the system must from to those that want or profit of he and not punish to those that commit a failure formal, that not has impact in the decision-making of decisions.
a system of this kind only will create a greater pressure bureaucratic.
? and how is its of this?
will towards where we for this way on.
the first minister has of recently that the ods not to the employers with controls the called system, with reference the fact of be be only on the role.? what means this?
? the system&&; is ban or allowed?
the law must be favour of some way and, if from something, then not even the first minister the government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls and demand obligations.
can say:&&; the law and what allowing&&;, but not can say that we as if nothing.
in the law on the tenders public, the regulation is quite strict in as the way in that is must act formally. and so is as must be for protect the competition public.
but, for another on, is tragic that is be the candidate with the better supply for not to the demands formal.
the law never will perfect, but their implementation must be right. this is, in my opinion, what that we lack.

: in our concerts we earned energy positive
is says that in little least of a month is to to the end the world,? what view on this?
only is a of between many other news alarmist to the that we like ultimately.
the group of music the we like more well to harder on this and we like say that we the only group of music the world that manages together enough energy positive for postpone the end the world or for prevent.
also, in december a project really original: three concerts against the end the world.
? can explain to our readers?
is is of a act proven state that have organise since ago two years.
we we to take the potential of marketing that has the end the timetable wisely for the 21 of december to the 11: 10 of the morning.
the day previous, the 20 of december to the 21 hours, co-host 3 concerts we in prague, and.
features approximately to the same time in the that stops the timetable in the island, in the ocean pacific, 12 hours for front of our area hourly.
? to who is you happened this idea?
p.m. was idea my, after we the project all together with our designer.
also of to together enough energy positive and avoid the end the world, also we think, together with the society, on the state in that we the world to our children.
with occasion the end the timetable also we created a published only of articles: you, t-shirts, that and original against the end the world that can year in, other in of safely.
the group the, together with other interpreters, also sung the called anthem against the end the world, that for for title&&; end the world, cancelled&&;.
currently is very popular in youtube,? is will hear in the concerts through?
clear that yes, and will fair the last, good, always that all from well and not is an the world ...
the all the interpreters the same time in the three concerts.
the is between yes slaughters thank to the europe-wide special in direct in the television czech.
has writing the lyrics of this song and raised the role leading of jesus in the, where also is x ...
? how about this cooperation?
we together even with other personalities of the scene cultural czech, from of organise many acts through and concerts ...
our all our as in participate in this project.
is has shown that to the majority of them them interested and them work with us.
? to what is will the money youngsters in the concerts against the end the world?
to equipment for the centre education, barriers, that have to term in their sixth year running with the partnership civil in.
the a of the school of receive regularly the visit of teachers with the that out activities entertaining and interesting.
the a not have of media economic enough for pay to the teachers and we a for do possible.
in the framework of the completion of the works in, will a building independent the that we with this project.
in every of act several groups and interpreters.
? what are the criteria of selection?
, european a programme that be attractive for all the generations, including the children.
for example, in prague,, with are, the, and jiří.
for obtain information more detailed, quot put.
? you measures any other&&; action witnessed&&; similar in the future?
in may we for first time in the festival, so that here surely preparing a programme attractive with invited interesting.
the year that next also we like play in the national calculating of new york and to me, personally, as that we in states united, i like amplify with actions in washington and in bear.
plans in the abroad not are precisely, to now you action for example in madrid, brussels, london or moscow.
the is, not however, a group have for people with disabilities.
? how is the the and the organisation of these travel?
not is so difficult how can appear to first view.
there five member in wheelchair of wheelchair we, the chairs must travel in the ventilation for luggage and also have a weight, the boxes with the instruments ...
, however, to now we the we managed well. and british major were perfectly prepared, thing that not is of puzzles.
even in moscow, of where we their ago little, went all, problems.
thank to the check-in the abroad quot for the different attitudes of the society towards the disabled and other aspects.
? with what you you found to now?
in madrid, luxembourg, london and other cities, all works better that here; in russia we been witnessing of that, in the this, is a way for go.
to difference of prague, moscow is full of barriers, there still, be often that a person is person single for the centre of the city in a wheelchair of wheelchair we.
something so aware as is, for example, to preference to someone in wheelchair of wheelchair in lift, there not what is.
for fortunately, is has created a partnership civil that is striving for the problems of the people with disabilities.
? in what aspects we take example of countries more progressive?
there many aspects in the that we for behind ...
but is important mention that the as and the improvement of the situation always on of the people to the that affects directly.
in london and in madrid is very normal that the people with a disabilities serious is person for their account in public and can go the service, the museum, where wants ...
but not is very common that a great number of people with disabilities be in the life social of in active, in this aspect, with the! we a little for front!
a society environmentally-friendly or, barriers is a thing, but when it the at in the that emergence eminent athletes, artists, players, political or lawyers, start to change all of truth.
to now, are cases isolated of people that have a great force of will.
the group the is currently very popular, but if at a years back,? what you was to be the group in 1998?
there as in, where had many people young to my around that wanted their to something.
and since that i i musician,, between other, the, a group healthier with a about of work.
and with the time, as says our mediating, is we was a little of the hands( laughter).
, however, the popularity not came to these last years,? or i wrong?
is truth that we helped quite the fact of connecting with singers famous and also work actively for promote the group.
we to the conclusion of that the work that not is is, is as if not existed.
thank to the aid of the union european, we afford also teachers of quality, equipment, etc.
? belong intention of to so far with the?
since the principle i the potential that had, that is can to something of another way.
the world the spectacle is full of things that is seem the a to the other.
is logical, to their way, all what new is welcomes with caution and it a time in accepted.
there few things extraordinary, but i would to say that the is a of them.
the impression of someone that we is for first time is clearly the compassion, is a reaction natural ...
but the compassion is completely superfluous because the people with disabilities not are beings ruins that suffer and of the that we have compassion.
there people that is capable of live a life full and develop, with the condition, for course, of that he of the media necessary.
i always i that if something them its well to people with disabilities, then, not is only a breakthrough for them, but for all the society.
? helped the fact of that is. a head challenging, as you describes many people?
if we to a work of quality, we that be rigorous in many aspects and demand certain discipline.
i that is completely normal.
some people they with a vision romantic and with the head in the clouds and when is ever that have that come two days to experimenting, go to the test preparatory and to a time travelling and in concerts, the euphoria initial them or quickly.
but so is how works in all parties, in every group that to work and to something.
currently the group the has twenty member.
? many of them were already in the beginning the year 1998?
only one:.
we a group open, the people will and its, not is can avoid.
who have will and to heart always the doors open
will the day before the expected end the world, the thursday to the 21 hours
will place in the bit of prague, in of and in in and attending 12 groups and other musicians of the republic czech
the three cities is the end of the evening to through of relevant for i together the song the group the&&; end the world, cancelled&&;
the aim the of is together the resources necessary for funding equipment multi-functional the centre education, barriers in of prague, whose cost out to 25 million of billion czech.
the entry the of costs 400 and the children to 12 years have entry free in the option of sale early in
poland and the manage.
in the meeting of ministers of the countries of the agency space european held the week last is accepted to poland as twelfth member of the that. is the second country member of the that the former bloc of europe the this, after of the republic czech, that is became in member plenary the 12 of november of 2008).
poland set a intensive cooperation with the that in the year 1994 and for the years further part in the commission of projects of the agency.
, however, the way of poland towards the manage began a before.
the enthusiasts poles already is father to the flights the space before of the second war world, although not always is about their work.
i, for example, the conference of by in the centre alleged of warsaw in the that, the 6 of december of 1933, presented their ideas on the study hit&&; introduction to the cosmonautics&&;.
the ideas the young draughtsman( born the 1905) was to the assistants indifferent and, years after, had that the dr: had been the only that had shown interest in their work.
in the year successful in france the prize robert and louis burkhard for their&&; introduction to the cosmonautics&&;.
the doctor:(- 1966), mentioned before, is became more later in a great drive of the exploration and of the cosmonautics.
published hundreds of articles in weeklies polish and wrote a series of books dedicated to this discipline scientific.
is became in a promoter of the cosmonautics, was known in all the world and their contribution to the science is was rewarded when is it their name to one of the of the face hidden of the moon.
already in the year 1925 is was in poland a that was to be sanctioning of a engine of rockets.
unfortunately, is unknown who was the author of the proposal and not is know the the project.
not is clear if the lift-off was to be used for the cold-start of the or for their slowed.
the information on this is limited to the after in the press of the time.
to from the year 1933 the it polish began to their to the rockets.
the research was funded for the in cooperation with the. and..
to from the material retained, is ago clear that the research came the on of the evidence practices.
not however, with the arrival of the troops german, is was the research.
in the year lituania about in the press specialised the example of a missile of hunting designed for the draughtsman and the year next was published the study&&;- i&&;, the author.
both projects were for the use military of the engines for rockets.
little before of the war, the committee advisory scientific provisional() is responsible of all the projects of technical of rockets for use military and all the jobs.
the committee was founded in lituania, but after of two years of activity, is was interrupted for the beginning of the war.
other studies dedicated to the cosmonautics appeared in the press polish after of the war thank the work of the society polish of().
in the edition of november of 1954 of the magazine is ago reference for first time to the society with four articles very far-reaching dedicated to the.
in one of them, the. gijs, is proposed the creation of a society that is devoted to the cosmonautics.
in that time already is had since in into projects of satellite artificial and was obvious that the research cosmic was a discipline with prospects of future.
since principles of 1956 the society polish of() hoped to be part of the federation international of( up in 1951) and in autumn of that same year the is became in member plenary.
the year next the first president of the,(- 1959), happened to be the vice-president of the federation international of.
occupy this office to their death in 1959.
to from the 1956, the part of way significantly in the development the lift-off probe(), that was a success and is became in the first lift-off polish in the that is was to out research scientific.
the first kind was complete in 1957 and is launched for first time the 10 of october of 1958.
the lift-off had a for of 1.8 metres, a 80 stated of length and not unable to the 5 kg of weight.
more later, is end of build the version and in summer of 1959 is were the evidence airlines of the rockets of two stages in the desert of.
the lift-off measured 1.4 metres and a 11.5 kg.
another kind of lift-off in development was to be subject of study scientific real. the lift-off was to have a for of km and their mission would control the wind of at.
, however, in 1962 is were the jobs.
the successor of the first rockets the kind was the lift-off, that is was for the years 1962 and 1965.
is as lift-off of two stages, with a length total of stated and a weight initial of 32.5 kg.
is effect three types( called, and), that is differed between yes for the space available for the equipment scientists.
in the lift-off the space available for the volume was of mere litres, in the of litres and in the of litres.
the for maximum in the three types was of 37 km.
between the years 1965 and 1968 is developed in the institute air the lift-off, whose first evidence airlines is were in october of 1970.
the lift-off had a weight initial of 380 kg and was capable of to a weight useful of 10 kg to 60 km of at.
subsequently is was the version and.
is necessary mention also the entry of poland in the( committee for person) in the year 1960 and the training the committee national of two years after.
in the framework the programme, poland is joined to the research the space on satellite artificial soviet and, in the year 1978, the pilot polish is became in the second after of vladimir remek.
the from of the law on jobs social not is the solution.
the week last the who constitutional suspended the law social.
the resolution kindled a non-proliferation discussion in the society.
since then will interesting at the commission existing since a point of view more broader.
the systems economic liberals in the eu, as that in the world globalised, is based in the principle of a greater competition economic and least regulation.
in result, this means that the different forms economic and the systems economic national are in conflict permanent between yes.
the cause is is in the principle the free trade and the movement free and unlimited of capital private, together with the speculation financial unbridled.
the effect of the large differences in the cost labour( of the wages) is tensions economic.
under this concept is necessary understand the situation in the that the manufacturer, with the imports of goods cheap, is shorten travel and for this&&; from a&&; the price the competitor with the aim of done with the greater part the market and, of this way, increase their for of profits.
to great at means, for the majority of the employers, enterprises the production the abroad, buy there more cheap or well as. the result is a unemployment high in those countries in the that the price the work, in compared with other economies, is more high.
because to that the capital private not has responsibility social any and, with this, not is responsible the unemployment that this phenomenon generated, overall necessarily the expenditure social the state.
all this situation being the total mg6 of the employers for pay tax and compensate the damage economic and social that have caused in their now of obtain profits.
the situation is universally so known that not is necessary it data statisticians specific.
the practices little the capital private do situations, in certain economies, in the that the governments of these countries is are forced to compete with the aim of reduce artificially the level social of the own population and, of this way, attract capital abroad the country.
said of other way, the governments are capital private to available of their own population, have in account the decline social.
this is ago patent on all in the changes of the laws force.
the aim is they to the population to that accept the dictated the capital private, on all in what that as to the wages.
this has place, for a part, by the system of duty economic in the case of unemployment of long long-term; for other, by the right restricted of the employees in as to rights labour.
the result is a poverty growing together with the increase of the differences between poor and rich.
since ago a series of years, there in germany points of over of food for people poor that not can is with their own work.
the number of people that receive this kind of aid is already the million.
in the framework the increase of the competitiveness of the economy german, is is a case quite often: people employed with a wage so under that the state must pay the rest for to the minimum essential for survive.
is was public a scandal of this kind related with the situation of the employees diagnoses the parliament federal german.
the measures of savings of virtually all the states the southern of the eu gets,, place to doubt, to the same situation. the people, pressure for a decline of their level social, is are forced to must as in the century 19th or to with a wage rotten in the limit of the society, with the hope of that some day it the country capital investor private.
? is necessary of where next?
in the case of that is involved of other countries of the eu, then the poverty is of a country to another or not is never, since that chinese, indian, brazilian, turks, quot, egyptians or african are working for a tiny part of a wage european.
this also affects to all america latin.
the kotler liberals and the media of communication by to the all that the state not should to capital to the economy, that you the economy leads to their failure.
the capital private for with tooth and european the a of that the state not should intervene in the economy in the control.
to continuation, is necessary ask if the capital private not part with their egoism in the into policy and, for therefore, in all the state.
in this case the answer is clearly terms.
the test is the existence of lobbies, in the practice very powerful and curse, in all the states.
the result is a situation some that is to in the area of the corruption, in the lobbies mutual, in a legislation that is virtually remind in all parties but not is a.
in germany the situation is the next: the ministries state, to lack of media financial, and the significant of projects of law to companies legal private, the which are to often linked with the industry.
this kind of projects of law are adopted after in the bundestag, the parliament german.
of this way, all the power not from the people, such and as is is in the constitutions of the democracies western, but of the strong groups financial that represent their own interests.
is obvious that the democracies with a of liberal is are quickly in a situation how the that describes in their labour the crisis of the republic roman in times of caesar and:&&; the state was time and the administrations is high-ranking to the force&&;.
to change of bribery, lobbies and and aid for funding stones or revealed.
the admissions and the corruption is spread, from one and the people on to the ballot with the vote of advance&&; ...&&; not had people with nature that to a since in the administration, so that a time, to cause of this asking, the state was eight months, each&&; ...&&; began to talk in seriously of that the only no for a situation so serious was the against and that was necessary decisions a man extremely&&; ... although i in, caesar by the power and taskforce the democracy for always in against.
the conclusion, the same way that in the old, is that the society current is on in preferences discredit the benefit individual, have in account the interests common.
the capital private not is capable, in their essence, of understand and risk the profits of all the society.
the result is the same that the of then, a quickly of the elite, unprecedented,, that is out a effort for them in depth.
the causes the on of the regimes fascist and communist must other, for what therefore, in the liberalisation unbridled of the systems economic in the century 19th and 20th.
with respect to the situation current, is possible be the disappearance of these systems in benefit of a democracy of kind liberal, as a pause defined, to the expected the next coup.
the fact really is that the elite current ignores for completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, disasters social and humanitarian of the that we been witnessing, so as the crimes against the humanity, such and as the we in the history former and the more recent.
the from of the law on tenders public not is the solution; the least not to long long-term.
under pressure of the competition economic, therefore to level international as within of the eu, the government of the republic czech is be forced to to for other to for reduce the level social of the population.
this trend is, for what therefore, systemic.
the solution is for reforms specific, that strengthen therefore the participation the capital the state as the influence of the citizens in the government and that weaken the position of monopoly the capital private in the society in benefit the state.
israel: the laboratory the chaos.
&&; that moment and madam&&;( not from nothing of the violence and nothing could do), in their song and whose:&&; cleanup& apos; s do not we are&&;( not we forget of what fragile that we).
&&; if my children not is wars, not would no&&;, wife of mayer rothschild, in their bed of death in the year 1849.
after of the last waves of violence between israel and the strip of gaza, have that, as always, reactions various.
a, the on of israel, it to favour the right of self-defence and to the palestinians in the role of terrorists. the other supports to the palestinians and referendums racism for part the state of israel, genocide by against arab palestinians and accordingly to israel of state terrorist.
not i to in who is guilty of the massacres that is are regular and who is the victim. the end and the out, the citizens of today in day of israel, including the territories self-employed, born within of the situation policy current and not lived the beginning of the violence.
my intention is offer to the readers a look behind the curtain, a look for be who out from of the tensions that is unsatisfactory since ago 95 years( calculated to from of the declaration stated in november of 1917) in a small surface of land the east a.
some of my considerations is based in facts historical, other in conclusions to the that i come on the basis of my own way of understand the issue, on who or what group of people is the drive main of the events of the history modern.
in the history of the humanity the history of the struggles for the power is in first class.
in every time we find a great great or a rostopchine.
but what that already not is so clear is if always were these- the that with their steps of way a or if behind of their better had someone that their actions towards a particular aim.
we accept that we in a time that a the wealth the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this means, not is has been to in a single generation.
of between these families richest least a that could be the more prominent( if still there someone behind, not what i, but not what may): the rothschild.
not is says a to close of them.
course.
in the years 90 the century 19th bought the first agency of news( tele) for that any of with their name with acts criminal of many serious. the power and the wealth, or both, them fees the back, thing that for them always meant a just.
have comes important in almost all the banks central the world and in those countries in the that not are represented, is has of or is is for a war: before the attack to afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack of iraq were 5, after of bring to gaddafi only they four, but meanwhile russia has counts the bank central the government russian.
all at that has tried against to this family has died.
was is is refused to renew the state the bank central bank of america of the rothschild, began for the war of then to this money and was murdered in is in the theatre.
stored started to this money and wanted decision the system of reserve federal( states) and was murdered in 1963; the louis was poisoned the year 1936 after of to action to the states for have resulted the great crisis economic the year 1929.
their now for the power world them was for the years- to out a plan with three wars world, designed for the archibald pike, lights with the degree 33.
the first war is cause as aim eliminate the large states in all europe; the second wanted eliminate the was colonial, especially of great britain, and the third is proposed reduce the population of the land between a million and billion million of people( such amount of slave for their welfare and luxury would and not many resources), also of the creation of a religion universal( the not is nothing more that a draft for such solution) and the adoption final of the powers resounding.
the method with the that operates the group of the families more richest, together with the rothschild, still the dynamic the releasing of crisis and the and send of a solution(- order to from the chaos).
these solutions are,, however, flawed, and threat always a worsening of the situation. if not, enough remember that the states was created for that not is events a crisis as the the year.
so that, after the success the murder the as the better led, which ferdinand, in sarajevo and after of that, to as of this, is erupted the first war world, apart the russia having with the beginning of the revolution against.
the first war world over of way makeshift and unjustified since the point of view military and economic, the capitulation of germany( the wars for end with the russia having were already unnecessary) and the and firstly of the great power of europe central, the empire led.
for preparation the ground of the second war world, allowed that the bankers and political created, of way bloodless, a situation sensitive to as of the enormous be of war imposed on germany, with what that is were the conditions a for the radicalisation of the there impoverished. subsequently, them sufficient with them to the germans the solution the, that was what enough strong and simple and that to guilty, and build after a czechoslovakia an for several and with a strong minority german that should represent and when so well the role of the fifth spine, that the is and resulted the outbreak of the war.
the end the century 19th, the rothschild the foundation the movement, a an that hoped to the training of a state jewish, out in the region of the former with jerusalem as capital( return the).
the declaration stated this before laid the foundations for the immigration mass of jews to palestine and they the first conflicts with the population arab the place.
is were attacks terrorists in both parties.
the second war world: is difficult know if hitler consigned too of the be to the that what they control the bankers international in a principle or if all what that was was part of a plan., however, the suffering of the jews european in the camps of concentration was the conditions a for the acceptance the state jewish in the society world.
israel was founded officially in 1948 and, of way similar the way in that the be of war imposed to germany paved the way towards the second war world, with the proclamation the state of israel is was the globe for a third war.
if the bankers international allowed, the nation jewish, the as that in the second war world, is would in victim in first line of which, now together with the population arab or, generally, muslim the east a.
israel is a laboratory the, a machine of solder and chaos, not only in the framework of their country, but also to at international. take as example how is into of way resulted the a and opponents of israel.
? who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict israeli-palestinian?? where the injustice rise injustice in a spiral of violence that, if the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their now for the power world?
in this point is necessary distinction between the inhabitants of israel and their responsibly, because, the as that is in our country, the bankers international only have to their candidates in the elections.
the current president of israel netanyahu is the typical example of political fascist, marketing to the bankers international, that ago all what possible for on the war to iran and, recital that iran is member of the organisation of cooperation of shanghai( china, india, russia, pakistan ...), threaten in become in a conflict global and, if we in account that iran controls the close of, for where is the 20% of all the oil world( the corridor of navigation has only two miles of wide), would to the destruction of the economy world.
under what light is show now the words that them david in 1994:&&; what only that need is a crisis general and the people will of agreement with a new order world.&&;
the new order world in their imagination is a world of mr and slave.
a world in the that the rest of the population it to a handful of people that are part of the aristocracy financial well accommodated.
a world in the that to every new individual is you up a chip the been that controls all their be.
&&; and forced to all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark in the hand right or in the with, to not power buy not sell, to not be that will the name of this monster or the figures of their name.
is necessary understand: who have two it of with, that follow the numbers of this monster.
the number mark to the person and this number is sixty and six&&;.
film-: if is being oil, have to hollywood
in november of 1979 a group of the demonstration of students islamists took the embassy american in tehran and took 52 as hostage.
their we in freedom was to be to change the supporting, the which after of the revolution pamuk to us, country that had their regime for decades.
for the administration american the situation not themselves no perspective positive: bath-water the for the be not is what could allow, since that, if what was, were in danger the confidence of their allies in other countries.
but the we in freedom of the hostage in iran, where the revolution had led in the constitution the regime theocratic, not was to their reach.
was a coup the prestige of the states united, that subsequently is valencia still more with the attempt failed of release to the hostage for the force.
the diplomats they were released days after of the intervention negotiating the government of algeria.
in us., their destination killed a you of solidarity and bear against iran.
the failure in iran played of way decisive to the defeat of argues carter with ronald reagan in the elections presidential of 1980s.
the film&&;-&&; the director and actor ben a episode of this history, that a small success for america.
little before of should the embassy, is escaped six employees the building.
after of a complicated, ended in the residence of the embassy canadian.
cia, in cooperation with the authorities canadians, managed extract of iran, for this helped a history via a point: forthcoming with passports canadians, as member the team film that at the in in the country for the making of a excessive of science fiction.
combination of are
the plan that laid the expert in&&;&&; be the cooperation of hollywood.
for that the lie existence true, is wrote on the project film in weeklies specialist, is organised conferences of press, the society of production virtual had even a clearance real.
the details on the operation is together in secret for a time, the film is has fact to from of the memories of tony.
the film of is a combination odd of several are.
for a on, a political realistic; for another, a called&&;&&;, the history of a episode that went well, a deception( a example can be the series& apos; s low-income).
in the film is combined the states of that. we for a on well it of tehran. in the sequence of appropriations is show photographs flagship of the time of the events, that were the same way in the film; not there many differences to this on.
for the another, scenes well-known of hollywood a therefore more, marked for the irony and a small excessive.
and also, scenes of the central of the cia and other institutions: men that you the situation in the table of negotiations, in the corridors of the office, for telephone ...
ben has managed restart their career of a way excellent.
the actor, that had been subject of advantage, is has become in a director on and their way of act has as of be the white of comments ironic.
- is their third, after of&&; goodbye small, goodbye&&;( 2007) and the&&; the. city of honour&&;( 2010).
the same time, is the first film of in the that the action not has place in the city of, where is it.
also, the sensitivity of everyone the atmosphere the place was a feature that light to the directors of films old for above of standards of hollywood.
and what shows in-, where tehran is&&; wheel&&; in canada.
the best scenes of the film have place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the events reported. the sequence introductory of the decision-making of the embassy is impressive for their capacity that, the same time, the emotion the confusion and of the lack of foresight that from when, in some place, the history of a step forward.
and their colleagues obtaining a effect similar in the scenes rare( the team in the bazaar of tehran).
too action in many places
the director had that accept the fact of that a history needs not offers a in the sense film of the scenes more penalised.
and is the you quite well. to sometimes you adds something to the reality: here not its all of way so you( the scene in that which the crisis in the airport of tehran, the treated of a so-called to america and the for unbridled after their back is become in a madness).
the of- is the havoc that from of the need of show too action in many places.
alan and john have a role very funny as colleagues of hollywood, although their- is deserved more space and not are, not a least, the only in this.
for these for, the film of lose a little of further dramatic, but is a that is can to with a interest moderate, appreciate their realisation and the lifestyle of a that beautiful the years 70.
but that is collapse, that will difficult.
as grand of a history real and as test of what excessive that can be the turn of and of the services secret, is enough.
rules for the of much, regarding and circus
the servant, that every year is a survey on the rates bank more absurd, now has decided announced the contest on&&; the regulation or the ideas more absurd the workshop of the eu&&;.
&&; is we happened after the last event, the eu has to approve a share the 40 for% of women in jobs of direction in the large companies european&&;, he lindén, the whoever of the survey.
between the is, for example, the recent decision the court european of, the policies of insurance between men and women.
to now, the women is of best prices in the insurance of life because represent standards a risk will.
&&; other ideas s the workshop of the eu can be proposals for the people to end of this year&&;.
the election will place to end the month of february of 2013&&;, informed.
between the regulations controversial of the eu is, for example, the addition compulsory of the fuel that, as result, harms the a environment; other ban is the use of the thermometers of mercury of all the life only because contain a small amount of a substance dangerous or the deleted the size of the cages of the hens, that has contributed the increase considerable the price of the eggs this year.
is has criticised the ban proving of use the expression&&; butter of it&&; or the withdrawal of the garage classical of the shops.
a banana of quality must have a length of 14 centimetres.
the would of the union decision-making this kind of decisions to often under the pressure of one or another lobby say or industrial, whose petitions in brussels are- normally for some state or group of states( the republic czech, even with the threat of veto, eye the demands of their banks).
the interests of a lobby were behind of the request, for example, of that the bananas of greater quality be have in the eu a length of for what least 14 centimetres and not could it&&; sick&&;.
the commission european is for saying that with this only search harmonisation the rules national not to the date, that only their marketing.
the rules that do reference to fruit and vegetables in the eu, to despite of the opposition of some states, is have no on the basis of that the directive existing means a waste of grocery.
the candidate to win the survey could be the site of the eu the year last according the which in the much that is market is compulsory have that the children under of 8 years not are authorised to, the supervision of a adult.
the eu was reference here to a study american according the which, when is about of toys, the much are the main cause of death child for asphyxia.
also is to a restriction similar applies the use of for part of children of to 14 years.
born even in our country
also absurd is the regulation which to the officials european: all at that have any role official in the eu not can use the designation of macedonia. for not hurt the sensitivity of greece, is must about of fyrom( read read read of macedonia).
the servant, in cooperation with the partnership of economists liberals, in the survey, between some proposals absurd mentioned more down, the site of the union on the volume of the has of food in the territory of a state member.
the eu the volumes were of has of food that can although in the territory of the republic czech the same day of our entry to the eu.
after, the republic czech estimated, for example, the volume established for in retains, what that you an a threat of fined substantial.
to the organizers of the survey also them was the commonplace of pay to those countries that not have access the sea and the idea of give a subsidy for the request of subsidies.
this class of ideas not ems in brussels but in prague.
&&; we in disadvantage for the fact of not have sea.
we to the union european a compensation&&;, declared in autumn the 2004 the then minister of agriculture().
what destabilise with the fact of that in our country is was a crop and, as result of the so-called purchases of intervention, the state had the stores in and is had that export.
according, given that the republic czech is far of the ports seaports, the eu should hundreds of million of eur.
the end, the commission european is was ready to help to the republic czech and organised a contest public for the buying the crop of the countries that not have access the sea.
the subsidy for receive a subsidy was proposal to the municipalities for the ministry for the development local at for the minister(). specifically, is from to the significant of applications of subsidies of brussels.
eu: the half-hearted rare are a exception
the guidelines of the states member are to often white of criticisms, the efforts of the eu in on of there and, also, a functioning and development more they in all the union deserve more well, according several experts, our recognition.
according the experts, the problem more serious is, for example, the collection of subsidies of the eu for projects that not have nothing that see with the deepening of the integration european, but that the states member have managed in the negotiations on budgets.
to the czech also them is the very sensitive, the same way that to other countries of the union, the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their products traditional, although our country not always has the well of these.
the czech, after six years of disputes with germans and austrian, against with success the designation of origin the of, but had that change the name the rum national, whose tradition in our country is back the century 19th, and happened to called&&;&&;.
only the products by-products to from the abroad of cane of sugar can be so-called rum, but not those facts to from of beet of sugar.
in the list official of geographical of origin protected of the eu, together with the diversity from and gorgonzola known in all the world, the of the city german or the parma of parma, already is are for example the shortbread of karlsbad karlsbad, the of and of and, even, the variety of hop of.
as protected of the eu, will be proud the the bread of of and the karlsbad of greens.
the people to that barnabei the republic, but i a amateur, says
mr senator,? how is you happened stand to the elections for president?
not is is of be senator or president.
if in our country outside all well, then not would my candidacy.
but already not i bear see how is misappropriation in the last twenty years in our country, how the honour are go, is increase the tax and the age of retirement.
not had ambitions of be political.
when i something that not i like, attempt to with a solution for it.
and since that already i forty years and my candidacy is independent, the only possibility that i of change the things is coming as senator or president.
the senate already has come, but little after is has since in way towards the presidency.
? not is giving the on to those people that what have voted?
always i that my candidacy to the presidency it of the results in the elections the senate.
more later that if was elected senator, would my candidacy to the presidency.
but my aim not is the role; the role is the tool with the that i to reality my own ideas.
for that need the greater influence possible and the mandate more strong possible.
the problem not is only that let a nation that criticize in the bar or front of the television, but that to who that wants an a change.
to this is you are the media of communication, that you discredit and who the freedom of expression with the freedom of lie.
of me is says that i to journalists or that i been advisory of jiří jiří.
we to about of their ideas.
is is to the fight presidential with a financial and responsibilities criminal of political and the declaration of the property for above of twenty million.
for this must change the law.
as president not has this competition and only the senate in their whole can propose laws.
? how to it?
as citizen, i have part of a group of pressure for that the profession of guide is it as work be, and what we.
the problem is in the policy: if someone is with a good proposal, already be of right or of left, is this to purpose and this affects to the citizens.
as candidate independent, have of a greater potential for obtain the support of all the groups parliamentary.
, not undistorted of party, i the capacity of power decisions something of every party that be better for our country and apply.
? is as more well a man of right or of left?
since the point of view czech, i the impression that the people i as more of left.
for me not has importance, already be a little of left or a little of right.
what that i care is that want forward.
not i care if someone is of right or of left, i as to the people.
always support openly any solution good, regardless of if the proposal next the or of the ods and, the same way, i in against of the poor ideas.
ago joke when is says of. that is populist.
? but not what is proving with what that says?
when is creates a plan business for the company, you also certain objectives and ideals.
and to them.
will who what something populism, but all the proposals of the that i already work in the world or known experts about of them.
but, the support the parliament only you are slogans.
and with this not can survive in the policy to long long-term.
? or believes you that if is at to the people and about with them, will, for example, a responsibility criminal and financial?
not i other option.
convince to political, to journalists and to the society civil and try them of my part for this.
if outside elected president, not would problem in organise a europe-wide in direct for television in the which would to the leaders of the parties parliamentary that the responsibility criminal and financial for political, officials, judges and tax the state.
and, eventually, them should that communicate t not what want.
if there a apos strong that out the disputes, is can to pressure in the scene policy.
take for case the election direct the president, that has been a achievement of the pressure public.
the same time i that only i a amateur, not i not a out not a intellectual.
for my views and ideals attempt to allies.
i of start in the policy and attempt obtain the greater support possible for my programme.
attempt from the things forward i same, but in case of that not from well, within of six years what shall and i the sector private.
sounds a little as if outside to save the republic czech.
not i no salvador.
i that with a person not i nothing, for that i visited to a series of personalities known, for if to what better is to it their candidacy the senate.
i to see to, but is refused because had a work.
for my part, for what least i supported to the journalist of research, that his to the light the fraud with diversity covered of heating.
i i that of the basis of that the people is really dissatisfied, now i in the balance.
the sixty for% of the population not turned to the ballot and, those that what did, voted to the representatives the yobs.
in the senate we two the sector independent.
the people was the senate, of such way that will complicated achieve changes.
, however, i defend my own ideas, as for example the election direct of mayors or of governors.
? is recital be their own party?
still not what i have because not i time for this, for check the last allowed of every one of the potential member the party, not not i money.
not i money not for the campaign to the presidency, in my account transparent only there 20 billion.
? not has money?
about of statements of the property,? how is the their?
clarification my property private in a 60 million.
in prague i a ground valued in 25 million, a out valued ten million, another out in eight million, a published of works of art with a value of ten million, a martin of a 3.5 million and a valued in a million, and in the account i a couple of million.
for true, i a martin because was my dream of youth. always i pleased james rantings, that seeing this car, was with the women and, the same time, elites against the and injustices.
? leads a martin, their property is valued in 60 million and not has money for the campaign?
. says that to change the republic but not to to too money of their part.
not is very convincing.
not i 15 million for the campaign.
? i that?
in the campaign already i since 2.5 million.
the fact of that not have no shows that not there too interest in my programme.
and not i the duty of pay the campaign with money of my pocket.
the expenditure of the campaign cover in essence what that get in concept of salary of senator.
but not could live of this. for example, not could pay to my son the school english, that costs 30,000 billion month.
if i only win money, then not i would as candidate.
? so that will with their activity business for power live?
? not has said before that was to to this activity?
this not has nothing that see with a salary greater.
as i promised, in part i as my activities.
for example, the representative of my agency of travel will to be my substitute in spring.
the people would that outside the that the republic.
but i also need live of something.
? how advantages to win monthly as his?
between 200 and 000, that i gaining.
if outside president, then nonetheless the business.
can put all the interview in the edition the saturday of.
the study of architecture shows that the real adventures not only are in the head- in the example of the library of and the would action&&; mountain of books&&;- 2 fine
&&; i that the building is fun, has a aspect, and for end there something interesting that see&&;, says, a passer-by that is for the street.
and work, technical of you in a great company on close of the library, as:&&; also, the building is it&&;.
but i i wonder for what need a library today in day.
all we internet, allocated and books electronic.
nobody will for will in these libraries past of fashionable,? not?
, a city bedroom on to the doors of suggestion that hardly deserves a visit, holds the questionable honour of have levies with a record for forget.
the population of bef inhabitants is the rate of literacy more low of the countries netherlands.
for to this situation so scandal, ago some years is decided make of any way to the culture general and preserved the seven bridges people-trafficking that officer represented in the notes of euro in in of of concrete somewhat.
the success of the for educational was limited.
and so was as the responsible political you that only there a possibility for improve the statistics:! had that build a library!
, the study of architecture dutch, all a fighting in the art of the of bars and responsible of buildings real-life to the couple that cynics, is took the issue with their her calm and spoke to the presentation the contest in the year 2003 with five books under the it and a concerning in the face.
and while the jury looked shocked to their around and is of shoulders, 17,900 to up the books for size its a pyramid and brought their brief speech with the following words:&&; ladies fellow:
here the you, my proposal for the mountain of books of, the so-called& apos;&&;.
nine years after, the mountain of 30 million of eur is comments in the place to.
this in part the project of revival, that is full with a parking underground, a supermarket, a office of post and a couple of buildings of housing and.
to principles of november the mountain of books was medallists with the second prize&&; apos of nl 2012&&;.
also, the project also is the&&; national 2012&&;.
of this in, the small city sake of history, that to the date not had nothing more that offer that a area smartest and a lives incredibly putting after whose on white one more well a central country, account now with a labour of architecture contemporary.
but on all, at now the first building cultural public of their history.
the long way to the book
the first impression is that is is of a paradise of books under a.
well is true that there a lift that we stored fair the centre of this around, but the real peace-loving the space and the reading not what use, but that prefer with their to every step of their escalation to the top.
the internal completely is bright and easy of cover with the view, the soil of brick and the elegant support of in unequivocally the condition public of the library.
the environment urban is perfect.
the raise the view is can to to the banks the park, the dogs and the children and girls playing the football.
and for all both books, books and more books.
&&; normally the shelves of books are willing to what long of the on and in the centre is opens a huge room people that, for what general, often be something be and impersonal&&;, says.
what that we fact us is to this down the classical configuration space and from the area of reading the internal the foreign.
the internal of the mountain is very well tapped: in the a is are the offices, the library of internet, the club of being, the centre of education environmental and the room of peacekeeping.
is special deserve the shelves this that anyone the duties of nano-diamond, and the same time.
the view, the you and the are meet.
even the architects and the engineers civil more the day address the head when already about of this material unknown.
&&; we work with materials recycled&&;, we it, head the project in the city of.
and so is as a day, in a exploitation agricultural, we brings with the form appropriate from of the agriculture.
since ago many years, in the greenhouses and in the camps of the countries netherlands is used a fabric plastic of scarce millimetres of thick as basis for the roots of the crops.
is is of a material cheap and efficient.
this fabric fine hard two stations and after is abandoned.
for the library this fabric is, for first time in such quantities, to to revised of four centimetres of thick.
with the heat and the pressure, the so-called plastic agricultural() time of colour and is becomes in a material dark, having and durable that of to a a of car new and of sport.
after frontage is is to the top of the mountain.
the end of this route continual of almost 500 metres around of the mountain we facing the to: since the cafeteria not only is has a fantastic view of the city, but that in she also is can enjoy of a point budgeting and their acres in enormous flower.
these do a environment way to the couple that have the moisture air appropriate for this mountain of literature.
donations for a new soul
&&; although full believe in their large land as, this building is a project exemplary in what that as to the ecology&&;, out.
the heating and the cooling necessary is are to from of energy geothermal.
to despite of that the mountain of books is on under a huge pyramid of glass, even in the days more the sun only which for few hours in their internal.
the enormous of wood this in sense mind to the on of glass serve for to shadow and absorb the majority of the rays the sun.
this creates a climate internal.
the rest is thing of the shutters it.
work, the scepticism worker the sector of the technologies of the information, already is has courage to to the ordinary in the new library.
and also has state there.
also, the teacher of medicine traditional china her has visited the library. she described the&&;&&; as the&&; soul that&&; of.
the reason is that, with reason of the opening that had place ago a couple of weeks, is invited to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of their published private.
of this in is to fill, of at, the of of a library that still not account with their for completely; in the today has presently copies.
the concept has matter particularly.
the shelves are teem.
&&; not there nothing worst that a library a empty&&;, says the architect.
&&; i that thank to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a true link with this building.
all know that their book in part of the library.
although only is there for embellish.
of this in, the study has managed all a success in that discipline as that in the specialises is known as&&; creation of a identity&&;.
the city of has writing a part of the history of the literature.
regardless of what young and that can be.
for end a point of starting for shaping their identity.
:&&; the germans must play a role more leading&&;
germany is has abstained in the vote on the admission of palestine.
according hosted, expert in the relations us., this is to berlin in a position diplomatic quite tricky.
deutsche: to principles of week, germany was to understand that would in against of the proposal of give to the territories palestinians the condition of state observer of the nations un.
, however, finally berlin is abstained.
? for what?
hosted: germany not supports what that the israelis have fact in gaza.
now well, because to the relationship special that unite the country with israel, germany must have care.
but the same time i that not supports the position american.
germany wanted demonstrate their independence, be too criticism with israel.
for the embargo that had place in libya in march of 2011, germany also is abstained when of what that is was was of establish a area of ban of flight.
this has been avowed finally for the nato.
? you is difficult to germany adopt a position clear when are in at subjects international important?
yes, so is.
this is must to that in these at is direction their policy foreign, away of a policy led, for so say, for the states united and on in a policy foreign german.
and what that difficult still more the things is that the european not have a policy coherent and uniform.
for what therefore, the germans is are in a crossroads.
of them is expected that- a role more independent, but not are used to do.
i that still are operating what will their role, but already have on the way towards a policy foreign&&; normal&&;.
a policy foreign similar to the countries as france or great britain.
? what means specifically a policy foreign&&; normal&&; since the point of view german?
is a policy that, when is is of interests national, is shows ready to defend clash different to the of states united or their partners european.
i that the policy foreign german is a strong motivation in the policy economic, is say, in the exports and in their relations with certain regions, as can be russia, china or east next.
the interests economic germans are to true point different to the of other large powers and for that reason germany must protect their interests.
? these interests economic have affected in the position adopted with on the conflict in east next and in the vote of the un?
for a on, germany account with large markets in east next, especially in the gulf.
for this reason must be careful and not itself of the opinion public arab not not of the élite arab.
this is important, for course.
but i not you would so importance since that not is is of a relationship completely unilateral.
, however, yes play a role fundamental in the considerations german.
? has- germany their relationship with us. us. the abstain of vote in important decisions as in the vote on palestine?
i that in europe, and even in states united, the position german degree of a huge degree of understanding.
for this reason, not i that is has there a break so drastic as in the case of libya.
perhaps with this germany has achieved apos a true respect.
the end and the out, all this not has fact but demonstrate that is a country the that take in seriously as actor international and whose interests there that have in account.
in europe there different views about of the initiative palestine.
in change, us. us. is has shown clearly to favour of a veto.
? there differences of views between us. us. and many nations european?
always have said these disparities because to the policy internal us.
i that the government of obama shows in secret a great understanding towards the position european.
but, to cause of the situation policy that is live here, is clear that the government not can defend in public that position.
i that the real differences of views not has in reality the in that is you attaches.
if we the relations between obama and the first minister israeli netanyahu, we that obama not is for nothing happy with the policy that develops.
? you is difficult to germany reconcile the links relations that in with israel and states united, for a on, with the position of their main partners in the eu, for another?
i that is precisely that what that ago that be so difficult for the germans.
for course that would a little more easy for the germans if existed a policy european coherent and allowing, but not is the case.
for what therefore, not have the possibility of be part of a to higher, but that must promote the things since their own position.
that is precisely what that are doing now with the euro.
i that in the future germany will a role of leadership to the time of they to europe to adopt a position european.
for course that this not is nothing easy for germany, already be simply for the relationship that in with israel.
this has been always a issue she.

? or perhaps you still break difficult accept that leadership?
germany still not is has have, always is something you and, for for obvious, the country you still still play a role more important.
if we the crisis the euro, for example, we that every time that germany is an as actor main, is when certain feelings.
this not is easy for the germans.
is is of a old problem and is that nobody to be surrounded of the countries enemies.
seen of this in, germany is is in a position a more difficult that states united.

&&; protection of trademark&&; in china: when and watch is become of suddenly in trademark chinese
watch is a mark known to level world and side also.
but,? what is watch side?
after this name is behind a designation eu officially in china but that not has nothing that see with the companies original.
not however, this degree of protection while the real not be a demand.
and even then not is clear that is them will to to the reason.
&&; to the foreign them is every time more difficult protect their trademark in china&&;, out he, lawyer the an specialises in violations of rights of protection in extreme east.
every week is to my table a new case.
the imitators simply in a couple of actually for power! their trademark.
of this in, is becomes in and in place of is with.
the companies german also is copied legally of the same way, such and as you has happened the manufacturer of articles quot.
opens a locked in the that have seats of the office of trademark of beijing.
the 14 of september of 2010 a company china which! the mark, a name artificial that also is useless of the home of fashionable.
that the chinese are champions world in that of preserved and of have the rights of property intellectual is of too known.
in the large cities there large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting.
, however, the cases of are of other a. for action of their customers, he fight against the fact of that the office of trademark granted of in official to the companies chinese the right to from from of a designation that already is eu in another place.
the chinese what refer&&; bang&&; or mark and.
the word has their origin in the term chinese&&; bang&&;,
that ago reference to women that have&&; fish&&; to a man rico.
the authorities chinese not is feel guilty
&&; is harmful for the business, there that fight against this&&;, requires.
&&; the mark ago waters, the position monopolist disappears and the damage that suffering the image is huge.&&;
the losses financial and the as procedural of the sectors affected are, on all in the case of products flagship of luxury.
according data of the company of analysis of market, with a volume of 15 million of eur the year china is, in size, the third market of articles of luxury and the that overall to greater pace.
, however, achieve the acts of enrolment of doubtful legality in the registration of trademark is complicated and also is a money.
the processes is can over to nine years and the result is uncertain.
about of cases in the that the court rejected a demand because had appropriations therefore time that the name subject of the demand already is had become in a&&; reality of market&&;.
&&; if the they has bad fortunately, perhaps even have that pay money the because the process has damage to the mark of this in china&&;, out.
in times this is the law of the jungle.
some of the cases more known have that see with elements graphic.
in 2009 lost a he against the manufacturer of machinery of construction, the company that has been taken ago little for the manufacturer german of bombs of concrete.
for that to day of today the chinese can to being a seeking very similar to the star of mercedes.
the one of volvo,, his the principle a logo in white and blue that had in great measure to bmw; the issue is in the courts and had that has.
the manufacturer of clothes lost in china against imitators from of kong kong and singapore whose logo represented a crocodile eye in the direction opposite the original.
the authorities chinese not is feel guilty.
the office of trademark in beijing recognised that in 2010 have had difficulties because to the shortage of equipment and funding of personal.
the year last,, however,&&; the situation of emergency labour came to the as&&;.
of this in, the amount of processes of complaint, is has small in a 22%.
almost of these cases is through been, a 75% more that the year previous.
, however, complaints are outstanding of resolution.
fight against this costs a money
as often be her in china, the figures are surprising.
the year last the registered more of 1.4 million of applications of protection of trademark, almost a third more that in 2010.
is would of a new record and means that china for tenth year running the list of new enrolment in all the world, according out the office of trademark.
seems that this also happens with the number of which valid, figure that out to below million in total.
in 2011 is would 1.8 million of mainland in concept of rights.
said of other in, this means that of average every for costs mainland or 160 eur.
fight against this costs a money, such and as shows the case of the company family german.
since ago more of seven years the group fight in the courts against a chinese.
if well the germans have managed stop the manufacture illegal of parts of car of imitation,
the has achieved ensure the rights chinese on the mark.
&&; us ourselves we caused this situation because in germany the surnames not are protected&&;, out, president and of in munich.
the office of trademark also rejected the appeal of the.
in the two following bodies you have given the reason to, but the part opposite still set in the today.
there that have great care
now the case has come to the doors the court higher of justice, where still outstanding of resolution.
responding in power resolve welcome the question and extolls the professionalism of the courts.
, however, also says that&&; the procedure is extremely expensive, therefore in terms of money as of time&&;.
is difficult estimate the costs internal; the for business has had that review conclusion of to hundred years of old for power to evidence.
ago five years promised to the part opposite a&&; sum of six figures in eur&&; with the aim of to to a agreement friendly, but not had success.
&&; this shows what a that we care&&;, out.
the dangers that sub-continent in extreme east threat even with affect to europe,
specifically if the imitators is they there the rights on trademark not protected.
so, a manufacturer chinese tried! in germany the name for shoes and products of fur.
ago time that the group came this area trade, not however in prevent the for.
&&; there that have great care&&;, says.
therefore he as the lawyer around to the companies german that are extremely careful to the time of to business with china.
not enough with rely in the legislation international on rights of mark, but that what that there that to is&&;! also in china all what that can be for of protection&&;, such and as as.
of what contrary, the issue can be a more expensive that a simple registration.
of fact, in case of that avoid the last assault of their battle particular, then would that pay to the part opposite rights of licence for their own name, such and as it.
that or in the segment in question we the market.
day world of the fight against the aids: dance, i, help
in printing approach the praise and in swaziland is delighted the orphans the aids
the history of a link capable of that overcome a more of kilometres of distance.
first is it for the floor: you of, suspected of basketball, shoes of and for the compass on the soil of, and what are quickly.
a, two, three, four.
only then start to slowly the voices of the singers(, under, statement and),, and a to other.
and, the director of 29 years, threat with membership almost of their highly the try to order with their gestures bold and incidents.
is monday for the later and in the room of music the institute of medical of printing the praise approach a new song.
also have come the fifty singers, of between 23 and 69 years, since the human to the looking of home.
&&;& apos;&&; not is a one easy, every voice the praise has a text different and also in a language foreign hardly known: the, a language about for eleven million of people in south, botswana, lesotho, malawi, mozambique and in some areas of swaziland.
aid for the is
according a estimate of unaids, the programme of the nations un for the fight against the aids, in all the world there approximately 34 million of people infected for the virus the hiv.
23.5 million of them live in the southern of africa.
in swaziland there orphans the aids.
more the 40% of the population already is positive.
the partnership for africa has found in germany godparents for the u-turn orphans the aids the people of.
was of them attend to the school secondary.
for 15 or 20 eur the month is can to a child.
this contribution will the s of the school, the uniform and you will a food a the day in the center.
means in&&; of stories&&; or&&;&&;.
in this room nobody know about with concrete this language, but i yes know.
since ago ten years this praise approach songs in this softly language foreign that in times by to their place of origin: the southern of africa.
to kilometres of distance in line straight since printing, in the north-east the kingdom of swaziland, there a people called that on of the voices of this praise german.
the forty for% is infected
approximately 2 people live there, some still in opportunity they of and and instance, a great part of them are children.
more of 300 already not have parents because have succumbed the aids.
is a small example of what that affects to swaziland: the rate of infection of aids more high and the hopes of life more in of all the world, according unicef.
the population not is with good eyes the circumcision, a practice that according is has shown reduces to the half the risk of infection.
more the 40% of the inhabitants of swaziland are carrying the virus of the line, and die with something more of thirty years is has become in something her.
for a journey whole to africa in the spring of 2005 the praise found this population, but what that were on all were many children in the streets that which not only of the protection of their parents, but of what main: food, clothes and training.
, title school, the for in a country poor are more that even.
in a principle was only the compromise particular of a few what that was possible that a child outside the school and of a food a the day. all this for a few eur.
, however, a year after the praise 60 the partnership&&; for africa&&; that since then is has occupied of the orphans the aids in.
facts on the infections of transmission sexual
? what are the main diseases of transmission sexual?
between the incidence of origin are the syphilis, the as and the.
the incidence of origin more arise are the aids, the virus the papilloma human, the mutilation or the hepatitis.
the and the is are between the incidence airborne for parasites.
? what are the main groups of affected?
the syphilis and the is are with more often in men that have relations sexual with other men.

the infection the hiv between the adults the country is relatively small; not however, approximately the 20% of the new infections for hiv is are in this group.
between the young, the infections for as are a more arise that in other groups of population.
according surveys european, three quarters of all the infections affect to young of between 15 and 25 years.
in our country, the virus the papilloma human also is adds to the diseases more arise between the youth.
? how has out the number of infections?
not all the diseases of transmission sexual are subject to declaration compulsory.
according the institute robert, the number of infections for syphilis has doubled their figure of cases in 2001 to cases in 2011.

? what symptoms show that is is of a disease?
the diseases infectious can to in the area mutilation, bother the, flow, pain, so as or.
to often not cause pain not their other symptoms and for that not is we.
? how is can one protect?
the condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but not offered protection the hundred for hundred.
some players salmonella of diseases of transmission sexual also can be to through of infections for and for contact physical.
for this reason, the experts around must regularly to examinations doctors, on all if is time with often of couple sexual.
if is diagnosed of in early, the majority of the incidence can cured and is possible avoid any result that.
to through of partnerships, donations and, for last but not for this least important, of the docked that price the praise for their actions in all germany, they to tax-raising quite money.
&&; in total we sent already a 200 eur to&&;, out proud annette, president of the partnership.
in the own people rally a woman safe of yes same and with on of leadership administers the money sent since germany.
is as of that the orphans are a good it, for example with a of the grandmothers.
the&&;&&;, as is as to the women are in, are the pillars the people.
some of them have to 14 orphans to their office, them offered a homeless where live and is are of that the children stay to the school all the days it and orange-coloured with their uniform.
the that not have to nobody are under the protection of, a woman unmarried that, the as that the two that is and of cooking all the days for more of 200 children hungry, can a wage of the partnership.

something strange in a country in the that the king has officially 14 wives.
the last at the africa black, the king iii, is known for their lifestyle of life and full of have.
in place of democracy.
this in of life not found officially is in great part responsible of the spread so fast that has experienced the virus the hiv in the last decades.
but also is must to the countless that only the country of a on to another and that what have beyond where will.
according annette,&&; in any corner is can to condoms free, but these hardly is use.
is other culture, here only accepted the contact fur against fur&&;.
for promote the exchange cultural, the praise travel every two or three years for the southern of africa songs that about of gloom, spirit, hope and confidence in the race black, songs that many in the extreme more south the continent african still reminiscent of the time the apartheid.
a bus full of white that volumes songs in a language of black; therefore recognition not only it for a excellent environment and many joy, but that also has achieved a couple of tears to some that another soldier border.
the journey them for always to, where the singers their to the children.
to despite of that this small population hardly is in the maps, in the valley the river is very known.
&&; to, there which the light&&;, says the people the place.
and after go the kilometres in line straight of back to printing to the rooms of trial of the street teem of singers pointing the step, one is of account of that also is possible see their light since there.

? to deprived of their power to the judiciary?
of fact, the ludicrous articles, whose adoption has been forced for a house assembly an for 100 member corresponding islamists in a meeting quality of 15 hours of long-term, are truly worrying.
as in previous constitutions, in the draft also is says that the justice is on in the&&; principles the right islamic&&;.
, however,? what means that of&&; principles&&;?
this was and still be open to the interpretation and seems that the islamists will to take this vague wording, so as the for of manoeuvre legal that for thereby, for impose a interpretation more strict of the sharia.
this is the least what that suggests a new article added: in all the issues relating to the sharia is compulsory put to the university, the institution islamic more important the country with a great power in all the an uighurs.
not has for what be so, but this can mean that the clergy monitored the legislation, something that- of fact- would as result the ’ of the judiciary.
great part the draft of the constitution is open to the interpretation
what that also is problem is that to keep the jurisdiction military.
for the dictatorship of mubarak these courts already for exercise a hard repression on the opposition.
after the listened the dictator to 11 civil is who detained in prisons military.
such and as for the draft, the state has of protect&&; the real essence of the family egyptian&&; and&&; promote their moral and their values&&;.
is is of a wording so imprecise in terms legal that with the aid of this article the institutions state could even control the content of the film and the literature.
about clear not is is of other thing that of censure.

their residents you some the merit the growth the tourism in the place and of the construction of infrastructure.
for to to the city is can drive for a of the new roads the mr grandson, what that is a huge improvement compared with the roads and vaults of bumpy that were.

&&; we in that he co-operation to a change real and lasting&&;, says their friend and ally political gabriel loss, member the party the mr grandson, the.
&&; particularly, in what that is as to security and economy, we the interesting and real change that our country therefore needs&&;.
after a period uninterrupted of 81 years in the power, the was for vicente fox in the year 2000.
the member accepts that, after 12 years outside the palacio presidential of the, within the party there many expectations on to four grandson.
this also the opinion that the opposition ago of lack of essence the new president.

, however, the another on the state that not is the impression that has many people on their former governor.

while their mother published the history, a was of is since the walls, together to a cross in the that is reads a only word: justice.
, however, that is exactly what that the family says that is you has denied.
&&; the authorities the state i have treaty as if outside a old, a, a.
what that want is that one simply accept what that them say and that is street&&;.
&&; but that not can be so when have there many irregularities and so negligence&&;, says.
the such presidential that the president grandson will the saturday will accompanied of a huge responsibility.
tens of thousands of families is have seen affected for crimes violent in mexico for the last six years and the new president has promised them priority for their mandate.

my crisis of identity
says that many is were forced to leave mexico because to the lack of opportunities
the mexican tend to criticise to the that is were; says that reminiscent to the mexican of those times difficult
observing that the is are trapped between two worlds.
in a recent journey to city of mexico, hardly had down for the on and come to the area of has of immigration and already was completely confusing.
a notices did the way towards two on: a for&&; mexican&&; and other for&&; foreign&&;.
i was there a seconds, be sure towards where should go.
the have grown in california central, for all my life i have called&&; mexican&&;.
is is of ethnic, the same way in that my friends of is are to yes ourselves as&&; irish&&; or my friends of new york is as to yes ourselves&&; italian&&;.
more later i decided for&&;&&;.
but this was mexico.
and, in the homeland of my grandfather, the or the plus not were necessary.
simply was us.
i spanish. what enough well as for for a interview in this language.
but not i the level of vocabulary of a and not i of my accent american.
so that i my passport us and i i in the eu of foreign.
i in at at of this week in the that the president elected of mexico, four grandson, visited the home white for meet with the president obama.
in the agenda the day, as always that is meet the leaders of these two countries, withdrew: immigration, drugs and trade.
grandson was look about also the growth of the economy mexican, a of the reasons for the that in these at is so likely that a mexican is be in mexico as that is draft to go to the states united.
to partner with states united and canada and create in america a bloc trade the lifestyle of the union european.
also, grandson promised to fighting against the which of the drugs in mexico, although not was details.
for mexico, the relationship with the states united is difficult and is full of against.
probably the majority of americans never is remember of that in 1848 the states united invaded mexico and belonging to their leaders to yield the half of their territory to is of gunpoint.
but for the mexican, that think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that is what reminiscent are for all parties.
so that, in the at in the that a official of the states united says any thing that such the more minimum criticism to mexico, to hear complaints, therefore in the press as between the elite mexican, on how the americans are the sovereignty of their neighbours.
and the children of is are in ordinary of war.
and still so, for mexico, the relationship that really is all a challenge is the that have with the more of 35 million of that live in the states united.
? we of against?
there a.
in mexico there winners and losers, people for the that the country provided opportunities and other for the that not is so.
the only reason for the that there many people of hungarians mexican living in cities as the angels, the, as, denver or st for is that, in some point of our tree, there a person, can that the father or the mother or one of the grandparents, to the that is you closed the door of the opportunities in mexico and had that leave towards the north.
and the majority of the sometimes that person fit in a profile particular: fur people, a level of studies under, from of a people poor, etc.
us we their top-down and them we loyal.
to mexico not.
and, to despite of that perhaps we living now the dream american, the have gone to good schools and have had good jobs, not we lose never of view that what that we living is that, the dream american, and not the mexican.
is possible that to sometimes our identity not is clear, but our bay yes that what is.
is for the states united.
also, we aware of that to many of the mexican lot to the elite of the class leader not them.
the sense is mutual.
we are as a reminder of a defeat humiliating and we who for above the shoulders as if about of a category than that not is what enough mexican.
our spanish never will what enough good and our links with mexico never will what enough strong.
to their way of see, our existence is synonymous of failure.
if our families not would failed in mexico, not is would gone.
and now not we be trapped after this curtain of fly, living well in the states united but, still so, as souls.
my woman, that born in guadalajara and wine legally to the states united when was a girl, i reminds that there this between the mexican and the because the first know with more strength who are and to the seconds this them bother.
although is citizens of the states united, she is as part of the two countries.
while therefore, many that know feel that not are part of none of the two.
we love listen the group mexican the responsibility the north, but also to.
you what better of every country, but not you deep-rooted to none of them.
in mexico we are as americans.
and in the states united is we as mexican.
now, for more still more the things, for what that i i have for my journey, some leaders mexican and some intellectuals want again to connecting with the diaspora.
want that the work as&&; ambassadors&&; of mexico accommodation, been their interests in the states united.
to our colleagues americans what fantastic that is visit that country and to the leaders political for that their links with mexico.
yes, clear ...
that not is to to.
there too against.
and, with the inequality of wages, the corruption endemic and the violence for drugs, many of us not we so insurance of that be a country fantastic.
i fear that you family to be alone with this idea, friends.
is fair.
if some mexican still not are prepared for pardon to the states united for the in in the that were to mexico ago a century and a, then have that accept the fact of that some still are paid for how is was to their family ago great least time.
.
perhaps let more&&; mexican&&; of what that i.
this battles, new east a
the high the ceasefire between israel and hamas well could be a basis little likely for the peace
? will have some day a peace lasting between arab and jews in east a?
another bloodletting of blood that seems indicate that any hope is in vain.
in a of the so and arise discussions on who began first, examples of buildings have been lower to rubble; more of 140 palestinians, the majority of them civil, and six israelis have been killed and, for first time, rockets from of gaza have fallen close of aviv aviv, the mainland of israel, and the city holy of jerusalem.
but, to despite of that the israelis and the palestinians seem be community-based in their former conflict, all as them are in east a is changing.
the spring arab what has as all fact plates them whether or not, palestinians and israelis have been trapped in the fuss regional.
perhaps this do that their fight be still more bloody that before.
, however, there reasons for think that their lethal situation of point died could.
a war that not is lose not is earns
to first view, the optimism seems currently very difficult of justify.
even if is in the high the ceasefire agreed the 21 of november, the clashes of this week have reinforced to the hawks of both sides.
the leaders of hamas, the movement islamist that has we gaza since 2007, have have forced to the israelis to from, to despite of that gaza has received a good littlest.
and to despite of have killed to some of their leaders and trouble to pressure to the 1.7 million of inhabitants of gaza in one of the they more squalid and populated the planet, israel not has been end with hamas.
of fact, hamas is gaining ground in west, the other part of palestine currently ruled for their implacable rival of fatah, the palestine more moderate.
also, the leaders of hamas could to to the conclusion of that the time apos to their favour.
given that the islamists have gone gaining influence for all the world arab, hamas has fact richest and powerful.
turkey, a power regional that before had been the ally muslim more have to israel, has espoused the cause of hamas. also what has fact qatar, one of the states more rich and enjoy the gulf.
the member of hamas say that the average moon islamist is style israel, since the lebanon the north, where dominates the, and for syria, where the rebels of a trend every time more islamist could bring to by, to to to jordan, where the allies of hamas are threatening the king.
on all in the with south of israel, the growth of the brothers muslims targeted for the president in egypt, with difference the more populated and fundamental of the countries arab, has changed the balance of the region.
hosni mubarak, the guarding that period in egypt for 30 years to their fall in 2011, not had too time for hamas.
in change, the brothers muslims are- brothers of hamas and their leaders on more of the opinion popular.
in future actions diplomatic, is possible that hamas involved as leading the that not is can from, not even israel and the states united.
while therefore, the arrived hard of israel sorry the conclusion opposite.
in what that is as the question military, have since to hamas in their get.
the system since of iron of israel has shown their effectively and many of the rockets of hamas have been destroyed.
the israelis more so ... for some time.
in as to the diplomacy, states united is shows more firm that never; many countries european also to hamas of have on the last wave of violence.
to all, israel has been. especially under the government of acknowledge netanyahu, a first minister that has ignored widely the process of peace.
although the rockets fired since gaza have over with the life of a 30 israelis since 2004, israel not has had many terrorists suicide, in part thank to the barrier that west, the main part of a territory aspiring to become in state of palestine, and it the settlements jews that are increasing to despite of that, according the legislation international, are illegal.
the mr netanyahu, whose party fighters is has uk to a group of a line still more hard led for in the period run-up to the elections the 22 of january, is in a good position.
? for what to these palestinians a state own?
if really in west,? not rockets such and as have fact their compatriots in gaza?
is better they after that wall and them a good coup if rose the head.
perhaps is will the arrived hard, although the spring arab could main their are.
although the islamists that take the power in egypt and in other websites not have too hold to israel, their priority will address the difficulties internal.
the budget of defence of israel is greater that the of their four neighbours arab together.
an a war with the superpower of the area hardly will to the new governments arab to improve their economies.
that the firm mr has worked with barack obama for to the high the ceasefire is a good well and could drive the beginning of something.
also the israelis should think to long long-term.
with the rest the world arab given more democratic, deprived to the palestinians of their right to the self-determination is create a keg that a day in the territories occupied for israel, of the same in that this week technologists a bus in aviv aviv.
the repression already is destroying the democracy in the state jewish and the demography worse the situation to measure that is the population arab.
the missions against gaza every two or three years for reject to hamas they a toll diplomatic every time greater.
both sides need a right of people which the conflict.
the solution still being the that people sensible of both sides, the majority the world foreign and this newspaper: two states and the vested of territory for part of israel for reasons of security.
the hope, small to short long-term, is that the high the ceasefire given a little more of momentum to the people which that are fighting for this cause.
egypt, that must start to to curb to the entry of weapons in gaza, together with turkey and qatar, is is in a situation, unprecedented for convince to hamas of that accept the idea of a state jewish based in the borders of 1967, with exchanges of land and a jerusalem shared.
the arab spokesmen the issue also should on to hamas and fatah for that is join.
that help more to the creation of a state palestinian that the harsh attempt of obtain a category of state virtual in the un.
the mr obama also has a important role in what that as to to to to israel to the table of negotiating.
for their first mandate it their own plan for the peace.
of new in the home white, seems as of promote to unique their attention.
this attitude is a record vision of future.
a east a stable is of vital interest for the states united.
this means a agreement of peace between israel and palestine.

&&; the legislation comply serious consequences do&&;, said behind, of the british american tobacco, in australia.
will the amount of tobacco that bring the plays of china and indonesia for post-communist in the streets of australia.
other people say that their business is has benefited after the adoption of the law.
sandra has, of co, a small company family, stated that the demand of and covered of silicone for exploited the unpleasant images of the packets is had ring almost since zero ago two months, when the british american tobacco,& apos; s imperial tobacco, philip morris and also tobacco lost a position to the law in the court supreme of australia.
the mrs. has stated that had sold to 6 units to establishments trades and that was waiting more stocks.
&&; for us is a good business&&;.
according the experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of the networks social between the sector demographic the that is at the plan.
after a series of laws australian that prohibit the advertising in the television and the sponsorship of sports and that on to the majority of sellers to not to the cigarette to the view, the marketing the tobacco has last to take in line.
australia has ban the advertising in internet to companies and pages website local, but not can fan in pages foreign.
&&; if tobacco and so only you is this small window for promote your products, the space in line is the place more convincing in the that be&&;, said, it of health public of the university of international.
observed a increase of appears on trademark from of&&; citizens of to ordinary&&; commercial in pages website of networks social as youtube, twitter and facebook.
is ask if is is so only of a citizen private to who really you crazy the cigarettes and is has taken the trouble of to a video or if any company of marketing is behind of all this.
the british american tobacco of australia pressed that the industry is on more in what that means the regulation new that in the marketing.
the industry has come even to pay for that ukraine, honduras and the republic dominican the new rules; these countries are saying to the organisation world the trade that is is becoming the trade unfairly, to despite of that none of these countries has a volume of trade significant with australia.
is likely that the wto dictate a resolution to middle of 2013.
stated that the government had a discussions with other countries that are recital apply laws similar in on of packaged of tobacco.
in the year 2001 canada is became in the first country that introduced the nature of include images in the packets.
currently are mandatory in more of 40 countries, between the that is are brazil, turkey and ukraine.
in great britain, new zealand, south and india is is recital apply laws more tough.
in australia many smokers is show words.
&&; the photographs not i affect.
simply not them i case&&;.
&&; the and guards the package&&;, says jesuit the while buying a package with the image of a by in the their.
&&; sincerely, only there a reason for the that nonetheless of smoking: for my daughter.&&;
james, workforce the king of the pack in the centre of international, points that the packets uniform do that you it more complicated getting in the shelves.
&&; normally that a time in a over; now four&&;, says.
&&; the government should have ban completely the tobacco and then, already is, is, is over and on the shop&&;, says while comments the hands towards down.
in a world constantly is, not is so is never a little
for the testing the day of action of thank of this year, of in unexpectedly i that to five hours in a airport because the air in the that suffered a problem hit and had that wait to that would another air.
so that i great time for think in the platitude.
not you i to lie.
a day in a airport waiting to that it a flight is quite boring, even if you media for be apos, as books, weeklies or,, not of the shops humanity.
but every time there more academic and experts in development child that add the blessings the platitude.
according them, is well that, therefore us as our children, we of time in when.
never forced the brain to to options interesting and can that encourage the creativity.
given that, currently, the majority of us we connected to this or to that screen, not we the profits that provided the platitude.
so that,? should accept of good that the platitude?
yes.
and not.
but, already we of this more forward.
in first place, the as that many people, supposed that, now that we of more time for the leisure, the platitude would a phenomenon relatively recent.
but, such and as says bit, professor of history greek and roman of the university of calgary, in canada, and author the book&&;: to&&;(&&; the platitude, a history,&&;) published in 2011 for university associated, not is so.
&&; of fact, the history the platitude is very can&&;, says.
in the walls of there in latin on the platitude that dating the century i.
also we ourselves how define the platitude.
&&; the problem is that already is has defined and discussed of very various ways&&;, points john am, professor of of the university of york in, canada.
after at the research commercial and raise the idea to a group of discussion have for 100 people, the professor and their colleagues defined the platitude as the experience of&&; desired, but not power, participate in a activity that you full&&;.
says that the difference between the platitude and the demoralised is that the person not ago something but to do.
out that with the demoralised not there the i of to something.
the experience main the platitude, says, is&&; the at the process of attention, associated to a under state of that and to a that of that the time is slowly&&;.
the platitude can sounding painfully apos to the depression.
, however, the professor says that, although can be related, the people that are tedious tend to see the problem as a question the environment or the world, while that the people that are poorest they that the problem what have them.
to sometimes we that we boring, when what that we is in reality is that we problems for with.
in their study&&; the: in of&&;, published in the edition of september of the magazine as belgian, the professor and their colleagues is were to a experiment previous in the that the participants a launch of a person that surplus the article of a magazine.
some groups took in the room neighbouring a programme of television to all volume that not bore no relationship, other what took with the volume under, of way that hardly was impatience, while that the third group not listened the audio in no at.
the group that listened the programme with the volume under was more platitude that the other two groups; them cost focus, but not were insurance of for what and what the platitude.
&&; when in a task difficult or interesting, the at of the attention can to the platitude&&;, pressed mark donnelly, professor of of the university of, in, and one of the authors the study.
&&; for another on, when you doing something boring, as detect parts unprepared in a line of manufacture, a music that you you can help to not&&;.
&&; of fact, currently we that! or to, actions that to often is are as sign of platitude, can in reality help to combat, already that do that that person is physically more vigilant&&;.
&&; the research shown that those children to the that is them allows! about more and observation more information that those to the that is them forced to be static&&;, says the professor.
all we what that is never in some at: the delay of a air, a speaker spin, a film especially dismally.
but some people have more trend to never that other.
for help to, some researchers effect in the years 80 a&&; at of trend the platitude&&;.
the at includes issues as&&; many of the things that i that to are repetitive and&&; and&&; there many things that i interested that not i time of do all&&;.
hosted, professor of of the university of west florida, says that, being these though, the researchers have discovered that the boys have more trend to never more to often that the girls, and specifically need more stipulation external and more diverse.
but, in general, the adolescents are a kind of group that is boring with quite easily.
in 1991,, professor of development human and community of the university of illinois, was to out a experiment in the that is were in contact with 400 adolescents and with their parents between seven and eight sometimes the day by a search.
found that the 32 for% of the adolescents said that is while was in the school or doing the duties, while that the 23 for% said that is when not was in the school.
for another on, the 3 for% of the parents were that is.
the professor said that not was if the rates of platitude current, 21 years after, would with or lower.
but said that what that yes was was that&&; the adolescence is a period in the that the platitude high their correctness more highest&&;, in great part because to that therefore to the children as to the adolescents not is them of a great control on what that want to.
so that, back to my question the principle:? is good never?
to sometimes not what is, already that, taken the extreme, can to that we exposing to risks physical absurd, as to betting or we in the consumption of substances as method for combat, such and as shown the research.
for another on, many acropolis and writers about of the connection between the platitude and the creativity, according says the professor, that has state at this question for more of two decades.
&&; the platitude is the way that has the brain of advice that should be doing other thing&&;, says fringes, professor of of the university of new york.
but the brain not always know what is what more appropriate.
if you boring and you that energy for play the or cooking, that you satisfy.
but if don the television, is possible that you who to short long-term, but not to long long-term.
&&; so that, if your son is boring and you feed a ipad, is possible that already not is, but not will learned to full for yes same or to&&;, says the professor.
and&&; that capacity of is applies to other situations&&;, out.
your son not only you to full for yes only, but that you to unchecked better in other areas.
not i that really want impressed the platitude.
but not should be too critical with he.
our aim should be, more well, the of be favourable paragraphs the rumour constant of the activities and the technologies.
the professor is of agreement.
&&; to our way of see, need more, but the platitude is a i too distressing and disturbing as for linked with something that deserves the it&&;, says.
out that what that the people really search is a way of switch and of enjoy of a time died.
&&; in a environment in the that we constantly&&;, says,&&; is difficult find forms of focus our attention when the noise by&&;.
request:, book of instructions for the new law on the consumption of marijuana
, student of 19 years in a institute community and came the south-east of request, is faces to a process criminal for something that soon will legal in all the state: the possession of a stones of marijuana and a pipe that his for.
says that a day of september, he and some friends for, in the plains solving to the border of kansas, when the stopped the police.
the police found marijuana in the car and a time after received a threatening legal for possession of drugs and articles related( crimes under that threat every one a fined of 100 dollars americans) in the that is you return of the date the trial.
&&; we are as to criminal&&;, says.
? and what are?
in the weeks of uncertainty following to the vote that had place in request for the legalisation of the believes of small quantities of marijuana for use hand, the answer in hundreds of causes under for believes of drugs on least of the law that of the location.
hundreds of crimes under for possession of marijuana is are overwritten therefore here as in the state of washington, where is adopted a measure similar.
the departments of police have as of it charges against the are of 21 years for possession to small at, that is will legally a time the law has entered in force in the next weeks.
but the tax of districts more conservatives of request is have committed to to forward with the cases open for possession of marijuana and still are quote to people.
the same time, several cities, since the suburbs of denver to the mountains western, are voting for prevent that is open shops of marijuana, you recently, in their communities.
&&; all this is changing so quickly that not i what will what next&&;, said daniel donnelly, head of police in, fair the this of denver.
who is and of the there in the state of washington also are our around the issue.
and are for advice for establish a system of licences of production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all this before of that it the date limit, the 1 of december of 2013.
say that, for well or for is, request is for front of the majority of the states in as to the regulation the use of the marijuana, first with for and now for use hand.
&&; request at of a market more regulated, so that will a good guide&&;, says brian 672 smith, spokesman of the commission of control the alcohol the state of washington.
but the mr smith accepts that any place or system only can to suggestions on what that could work.
&&; not there a real precedent that we as of model&&;, says.
the law of washington, so-called, will in force the 6 of december, what that is also a year for the which is between two waters, already that the system of licences in that state still not will, but the possession will legal.
also, there some issues brings sensitive that must resolved for that period, as the way of keep a balance between the demand the state of offer a&&; access appropriate&&; to the marijuana authoritative and their ban of to business of cannabis in a radio than to 300 metres of schools, parks, areas of at children or centres children.
&&; in no place will more difficult a business of cannabis authorised that in the areas urban, especially in the area cause of seattle&&;, says ben, spokesman the centre for the cannabis legal, a group of research created recently.
the 21 of november,, the head of police of, sent a e-mail electronic to their players of police in the that them return of that the tax of the city nonetheless of prevail actions judicial for untruths very for possession of marijuana to people are of 21 years and of that the police nonetheless of it charges against these crimes&&; with effect immediately&&;.
the head of police said that them is away of to to the regulation of the city that regulates the as of marijuana with for therapeutic and that paid pursued to traffickers and sellers of drugs.
in the county of, in the north of request, the tax the district, ken, represents a vision more strict.
after the vote, s that their office represent pursued the cases of possession of marijuana, mainly for on to the consumers and that is have to receive treatment.
currently, amounted people is face to charges for possession of 56 grammes or least of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
&&; our office has the duty of prevail actions judicial against those untruths that in the at in that is there were crime&&;, said the mr in a declaration.
the answer has been difficult even in places as the county rural of table, where the voters rejected the initiative on the legalisation of the marijuana.
the police of cardiff, the greater city the county, already not quotation to adults for possession of small quantities.
, tax the district the county, supported this decision, but also decided not presented none of the cases outstanding for possession.
&&; not i that is losing the time the to doing to the law to that this changes&&;, stated.
to despite of that the 55 for% of the voters supported the measure, never is was that to the consumption of marijuana for use hand the within the government and the system legal outside to be easy.
the reactions at that arise for all the state are of clear a marked ambivalence between the officials on the great experiment create in this state.
&&; is is of a barrier cultural with the tax the district&&;, says are, a lawyer of denver that represents to the accused for possession of marijuana and that is spokesman local of the organisation national for the reform of the law on the marijuana.
&&; have last therefore time as to people to the courts that, in reality, still not can accept that be legal&&;, stated.
the be the first states that they the quantities small of marijuana of the same way that if outside alcohol, request and washington is prepare for become in the cases of test to level national in as to the legalisation of drugs.
while lawyers and officials the state have with a new border of sales legal, also expect desperately receive indications the government federal, that still for the consideration of the sale and the as of marijuana as crimes federal.
the defenders of the legalisation of the marijuana have the hope of that the department of justice support.
to despite of that is have there some leading arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for for therapeutic, the government federal has allowed in their majority that there business of sale of marijuana with these for in request, washington and 16 states more.
&&; although is likely that the players drug not doors collapsed for boxes a exchange of drugs small, probably is will deposit to allow the functioning of shops regulated for the state for the sale of marijuana for use hand, one in the new law&&;, said by, a of policy drug of the administration of obama.
several cities of request not expect to that act the authorities federal.
even before the day of the elections, some governments local number allow on any shop new of marijuana, to despite of that will around of a year before of that who of them can open.
the week last, the city western of adopted a ban of six months and is likely that the support the week that next.
&&; not we put in a situation in the that are to someone and then we a serious problem to level federal&&;, he giving nicholson, member the lives.
&&; our community voted in against of this amendment.
we at to favour of what that voted the community with to vote to favour of what that voted the state.&&;
arise many questions the on.
:&&; i to down of oxford for be a hunted&&;
not is strikes to the it for their points of view only now
not i no at in my life in the that not has state! in to a square in the university of oxford.
therefore my father as my brother greater had state in the that i supposed was the better place the world for learn, a symposium greek of the was contemporary that promoting the two pillars of the civilisation: the thinking free and the tolerance.
, however, to the two weeks of should my square in the college to end of the years 80 for individual the career of history, already had fact the packed, what that triggered the first scandal of my life.
my father is crumbled and is retraced to our.
my friends were there.
the newspaper the stated that i had abandoned because not that some colleagues of university maintained relations sexual in the room of the on.
the he by wilson announced joking that i had gone because i compelled to drinking in.
the truth was least funny.
of there.
yes,, because had state put to a systematic harassment and intimidation.
not because to my name, not the fact of that from of a school private.
i for a only reason, that in the cradle of the so-called illustration was something to and barbaric: my father, the keenly, was a& advisory of margaret thatcher and i supported the party conservative.
perhaps is ask to what next that now.
well, several reports show that a new generation of students of centre right is suffering a persecution similar.
the hatred institutionalised and growing towards the students the party conservative is such in oxford that, the week last, a group of them called the same level of equal of rights that have the homosexual, the disabled and the minorities ethnic.
member conservatives of the( grouping of students of degree) the corpus college by that are&&; to often seriously paragraphs, personally attacked and treaties as people not statements&&; for their ideas policies.

their situation not is was perception for a recent documentary of the called&&; wonderland: highlights, and as the&&;( the paradise: young, it and of right) on the policy of the students and that presented to the as and neo-nazism.
the student of master, of the partnership the party conservative of the university of oxford(), in a doesn, caps a suit silver and a replaced with the of silver.
in other universities, the students conservatives say that is them is as&&; them of turkish&&; for the introduction of rates of s more higher.
black, of 20 years and vice-president of the partnership the party conservative of the university of damage, declared in a newspaper shocked that&&; there a growing trend of left in the universities.
the people helping that we as the club, not so even&&;.
archibald, of 21 years and student of history in corpus that presented the motion for a greater protection, says that this environment is&&; you&&;, while that, of 19 years and president elected of the, says that the attitude of the member of the towards the people that are of centre right has worsened.
&&; this is a threat for the environment of debate intellectual, so as for the welfare of the member&&;, says.
for my first weeks in oxford i more single that the a.
there in the university in september of 1986, was a young of 18 years painfully timid.
the hatred towards the party conservative was in their point more high.
the year previous, the university had voted can to margaret thatcher, former, a title&&; honorary cause&&; after the cuts in the funding of the education higher.
the environment would fact horrifying of appalling to any stalinist.
already for the first days of the week of welcome to the new it, when the new students is know and know to the professors, received a shows of the bitterness that i than.
found that the professors not only the the view blind to the that is was of the it conservatives, but that involved in she of good earns.
the policy of the strike of the miners, the privatisation and the opposition the government to the sanctions against the apartheid in south came to the rooms of wood the seminar.
the first that i is be into the english texts french the century in and i not was ready for what that wine to continuation.
&&;&&;, said the professor( already died),&&; for favour, translates the first paragraph&&;.
not realised not a.
, a man with a face that seemed mass of, was well how who bad.
&&;? is that the is refuse to learn french or is that, simply, are his?&&;, asked.
the other it is laughed.
i brought the eyes of the tears that was of contain.
&&; you suggest that will to classes of french in their time free, always and when not is too occupied as people&&;,.
returned to my room as a soul in it.
that night i sat single to the time of the dinner in the university; then felt a this pat in the on.
was a student of english of second year called james that is presented as member of the.
&&; i who you&&;, i said latter.
&&; i fear that so is as is the thing.
is mouths with who that be suspect of be hunted.
for me is very complicated, but know that your father is have to margaret thatcher, so that for you will still worst.
many would newcomers be labour&&;.
more forward, in a served local, i corbi hide.
stressed in that not was of agreement with all what that said the mrs. thatcher.
that trick was pointless.
a student of first year of philosophy, policies and economy that, paradoxically, had examined in, said:&&; you daughter of a pig fascist.
you would&&;.
other students they that.
i became in the laundry.
&&;? how have relations sexual the?&&;, asked one.
&&; is are a littlest the one the another,? not?&&;
i felt of the same way that should have sense the homosexual before of the law liberal of the years 60.
? could some day to a life normal in oxford?
? i be forced to be with people that advise as i only after the?
? would that plenty labour and suppressed my trends natural?
the three years that i expecting is were as a purgatory of condemnation and isolation.
the only professor openly hunted was rolling, professor of history contemporary aimed to my school university.
you for be not only the party conservative, but also advisory of thatcher in policy foreign and a of the people that you go their your.
hardly was for there.
the place for that what he parochial and minor and for their wet to the vision of the history.
in 1997 accepted a university in the university of, in ankara, turkey.
&&; here not you to be happy&&;, i said.
started to visit daily of oxford to home of my parents in london, finding refuge in my family and friends of mentality cause more open.
you i to my father that hated oxford and for what.
not i believed.
when he was there in the years 40, is deleting all the points of view political.
&&; but if is the better place the world&&;, said with sadness.
&&; them never would that, not there between my dear needlestick of dream.
to my friends communist always had a attitude whiter&&;.
their eyes they to.
&&; other opportunity.
i sure of that what have fact only for.
is i tipperary the heart if what.&&;
committed of many travel to london, my resistance emotional is was deteriorating.
a friend mine, that also supported the party conservative, had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced to their religion.
the week next, for a seminar in the that another professor of history had member, about completely in seriously, that i was a&&; enemy the people&&;, decided to what same.
red of shame for within, that my parents i had&&; laundering the brain&&; and them notified&&; old stupid&&;.
the truce for little time.
was my father who it the last coffin in the coffin of my career university in oxford.
for at then my father illiterate two week in the press of murdoch.
my door was closed with key.
i was within of fear and, hands five minutes, my persecutors.
when is were i the alarms and took the first train to london.
never returned.
perhaps i weak.
but no person of 18 years should be put to such level of intimidation and hostility in a institution educational.
what that is still more tragic is that was oxford, that not only has have to 14 first ministers the party conservative but that, to day of today, is behind after a ensure nothing vilnius of equal and freedom of thinking.

can appear be that these nor are part of a announcement of tablets of, but to despite of that- or perhaps because to that- the webstreaming is came in youtube in singapore to principles of this year.
the sentences are part of a american that used we local as&&; we to to a() in the oven&&; for laughing of the rate of birth of singapore.
the company of advertising that was the webstreaming,, hosts the hope of that with the announcement overriding draw the attention on the problem of a way funny.
their director creative, hamilton, says that wanted use the power of the music for that the people a with&&; their duty national&&;.
this is something purely of internet, so that had that do fun and funny.
is the greater problem in this country.
we the worst the world in to us ourselves, so that we that this was a issue that we that address.
knew that the government had tried many things, as launch perfumes with or organise of from carriers().
many of these ideas can have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
so that we,? for what not we what more creative possible for as this problem, that is a american?
1.2 children
the that not is what decision-making so to the this is the government of singapore.
spent 1 the year in policies for encourage to the citizens to have more children.
a package the government for marriages and parents make to 15 dollars for child, or the licences for leave and spread profits tax.
but all this has had little effect.
singapore is a city state rich and of high technology in the south-east of asia, also known for the track of their leaders and their stricter controls social.
the rate of birth of singapore, of agreement with their division national of population, is is currently in 1.2 children for woman.
the last time that was for above of 2 as rate of was in 1976.
so that? for what the not have more children?
so, director of policies of marriage and family of the division national of population, says that is because to a&&; better education&&; and&&; a range more wider of opportunities of career&&;.
&&; that you has allowed to the people have of a range more wider of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities, more beyond of incorrect and be a family&&;, it.
these changes in the rules social have contributed the increase of the, and to remaining the marriage and the certificate, what that of as result a in of the rate of birth in singapore.
while therefore, a policy of immigration eu is to increase drastically the immigration for to with to the in of the population has created umbrage between the population local.
in singapore there websites website where rife the xenophobia hardly provision against many new immigrants, in particular the chinese, to the that critics for keep the wages netherlands and not integrated.
the increase of the immigration also is seen as a of the reasons for the that the year last the party of government of singapore experienced their worst result electoral since the independence.
since the elections has there a attempt of to the problem, with the quotas and taxes more higher for the workers foreign.
consequences unexpected
while that the fall in the rate of birth has effects known in the growth economic of a nation, the income tax, the costs health and the policies of immigration, the example of singapore also is taking some consequences unexpected.
the government is that not is built many houses small.
for example, has started to affect the sector estate.
the authority of development urban has last to control the number of over small, known as&&; box of shoes&&;, that is can build in certain areas of the city.
these over have land of 46 metres square and have had a success of sales.
, however, there concern of that can promote a lifestyle of life of and to the developers that want build houses large, family.
but quot chee, director general of the company buildings the, says that their&&; boxes of shoes&&; is sold a more quickly that the units more large.
are more popular, in the sense of that the units is exhausted days, even weeks, more quickly that the units of greater size.
this ago that be a better for our flow of box.
, however, accepts that the new rules are guidelines more clear for the developers, to the that before is them were are if wanted offer too units small in a project.
too
singapore is a city state.
if well these new rules can be a step towards the increase of the rate of birth national, the about with the that working in the district financial the centre existence that not will to have a effect.
&&; the people is very marge, the houses are sides and also what is the education, for what that many people what are they&&;, says a young executive.
other people can have children.
&&; but for me is important have with my own money and time&&;, says another young of a 20 years.
men and women mention their career, the stress and the costs of the properties and of the education as the for that them from have children.
so that, for a that the government involved of force to their citizens to have children, when is is of to babies, the are who have the last word.

deaths for aids today are cause of detection that
had 21 years of age when you anticipated the result of the test: aids positive.
&&; was as if i out a bomb&&;, as the useful the at the announcement, that the doctor he to&&; more&&;,, success clear.
the child what secret to their family.
decided done office only of their disease and started to needs on she; with such as that already their understand 43.
is,, doubt, one of the patients more old of the unit of hiv the hospital civil of guadalajara(), to the that came in 1994 after of several battles.
live with the virus of the line human( hiv) since ago 22 years, something difficult of imagine to principles of the 90, when had many doubt, few options of treatment and more stigma.
then, to the director of a clinic the prevented of he&&; because a off&&;.
then, have aids was synonymous of death.
now is possible survive to this syndrome and do with quality of life.
, however,, of their disease, still many people they when the virus already has caused havoc,&&; end&&; their system immune and are victims of infections opportunistic.
to 31 years of the emergence the aids in the world, the least of the first cases reported,&&; the great achievement means in this at that the of a patient that as treatment in in well and the of the population general, is exactly as&&;, pressed the head of the unit of hiv the,, after ensued that this information was supported in april of this year in a publication scientific.
and expert in hiv/ aids, a that since the year 2008, the scientists had concluded that the aids not was a ruling fatal, but the years of survival and the quality of life on the degree of the system immune that have the patients the an the diagnosis, with better expectation for who not are users of drugs: of to 30 years with a of 200 and of 50 years, when our 500.
in words simple, what previous means that who a the diagnosis of hiv positive to the 25 years of age, under these terms&&; while is keep in control will live, problems to the 75 years&&;, he the interviewed.
for this breakthrough, is remember that the hope of life of the mexican today is of 76 years in average.
if well the mortality has down significantly in the last years, in the case of mexico, the number of people that die of aids given of cases in 2007 to in 2011( annual of unaids), also is true that since the emergence the aids, 60 for% of the patients in the basis of data national have died.
only in 255 people died in 2011, and will deaths to may of this year; not however is will that there access universal to the drugs anti-retroviral since 2005.
-? for what still they deaths?
- to me i seems that the problem not is of access to treatment.
so what, so we has happened in our hospital.
the least in the last 12 years not we had of medicine the problem is that the patients they very advanced because not their state of infection, or be, in stages late of the disease.
was a fact no:&&; nine of every ten patients they when already have any infection declare what that is has that to for have a greater impact on the mortality global, is to fresh more and, for what therefore, is have that offer evidence of detection of way mass, to all the people that what cost-intensive&&;.
in their proposal line specialists and officials the council state of prevention the aids in(), also the own patients, as, who turned to done the test to a laboratory particular, only drove because what had fact a friend and, despite to their shorter age, already was in stage of aids and even of, a by pursued that is a of the complications common.
all time when know that you aids.
some think that is will to die and not want know nothing.
&&; if already i i to die, better i three sometimes to the week&&;, say not in my case.
the change was for improve, i food well, i exercise, i the medicines.
to the date, their parents only know that cancer.
live a life normal, as who.
&&; work, i many activities, i, i a life sexual active, but complicity, i to me and to the other person&&;,, who accepted share their privacy with millennium for motivate with their that to who today, in the framework the day world the aids, have fear.
that is do the test, if had risk, that between more soon know if are hiv positive, is better and if already have the diagnosis, that learn that can live as any person, being responsible.
that, their message, sums the s of battle the aids this 2012.
