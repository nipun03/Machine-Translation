victory libyan
the release or rebellion libyan has already its vaincus.
muammar kaddafi is enterré in a place know in the desert and without him the war is over.
it still to determine the vainqueurs.
as it is of what in the region, the vainqueurs to elections are the islamic, but if the the the is of moderate or of radical.
the council national provisional has back the right as of the sharia and we know already of what it if the the the is.
the libya becoming a countries without crime because for a flight we core the hand.
the women can forget the the the the émancipation, the not facilities has dela faith are passibles of the penalty capital ...
it the the the is the koran which will unite to the place of the personality the dictator the society composed of tribes other.
in libya there a such order as we not can not we the represent and as we not the the the like certainly not.
but our way of live not the the the is not single, not the the the is not objectively the better and not would probably not modelled for the libyens.
it is particularly should that the emigrate islamic have accepted the the the the aid with recognition of dogs infidèles.
the only due it the the the is that this not the the the is not a general américian which pursuit the frappes of the the the the nato but rather allah which they célébraient the councillors to every attack.
when it if the the the is therefore of seek the vainqueurs in libya, the the the the west not the the the in fact not part
we have part to into, served the the the the islam and our poilitiques. are détournés the dictator in as that the the the ally policy without that this not the the the brings no profits.
after the recent have experiences of the the the the afghanistan and the the the the iraq, we not the the the, not forces the libya.
it not the the the there therefore not of problem for the local of. débarasser of the& the crusaders the& the.
what that without occupation the soil, the societies oil will easily accés to the the the the however black libyien.
perhaps not as and the the the the west will finally. vanter of the the the a protection desintéressée of rights of the the the the human.
for little that we in succeeded these adeptes of the sharia.

in the families of small carry the sport not the the the is also not a usual, this which is now the case of the most of coaches of the the the today the the the today- only 15% has answered that the the the the less a time by week the parents were the time for the movement active.
investigation carried on 900 children
the the the the investigation if the the the is awkward for the last year educational and have part 900 pupils of schools fond of polish-czech.
it the the the was the second edition of the& the the the the the obesity not the the the is not a chance the& the, action supported by the the the the insurance general of health and the society unilever.
since the beginning it the the the is more of 12000 pupils of sixth to the third which. are inscrits to this project.
the the the the a of factors determinants which tons a increase dramatic the number of the the the children in overweight, even obèses, is the the the the lack, of the the the a food correct and not enough of the the the president-in-office physical.
the& the only the half of children questionnés made by example eat 5 time by day small déjeuner-en case- apos- goûter- dinner, which is the the the the a principles of basis of the the the a good food the& the, made the the the the a of results of the the the the investigation.
without small apos and charcuterie the dinner
the specialists attirent the the the the attention on the fact that for have a development healthy it must few details of basis such that the the the a small apos in family to the even at.
in polish-czech, only 23% of families of pupils need to the my even at.
in the major part of families everyone takes its small apos only.
and the worse which has been up is that the the the a tenth of the population not takes not the all of small apos.
the small apos is yet the basis of the the the a good food daily.
the questionnaire has shown that in the families of children obèses we s more often of frites malsaines.
almost every there- without about the weight- nearing every day of drinks sucrées( 70%).
more of 40% of children questionnés fact the sport regularly but for the parents it if the the the is of the half, only 15%.
preparing you tone food
a another part of the the the the investigation has allowed to of children choose( 204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) of prepare its own food to from of opportunities proposed according their feel own and their opinion personal.
the& the the preferences of children czechs of 12 to 15 years are far, the plan of the the the a food;, of the the the the ideal the& the.
among their dish préférés it there has many of gâteaux, of nutritional and of sucreries.
the& the the more alarming is particularly a great preference for the limonades sucrées the& the, is as in the results of the the the the investigation.
for the apos this are the pâtes which have taken the first place just before the meat blanche.
the children not the the the have not the all to of féculents and the preference for the fish and the meal of vegetables was very low.
track on the health
the the the the investigation has shown also that the children are prepared to change their habits to from the at where they are the information ad ad.
the& the the in of the the the a control of the the the a group of participants to the the the the investigation which had marvellously the questionnaire after the sitting of awareness the& the obesity not the the the is not a chance the& the, we has assité to a will, determined of. should to a food; the& the, they the results of the the the the investigation.
the more containing has been by example for this which concerns the limonades sucrées because the children have started to give the preference to the the the the water of consumption.

the styliste must be also a good psychologist, say the professionals
in a article of presentation on to the way of the the the learn for the stylistes, i i am implementation a small little in angry the fact that the the the it there in had many as the beginning.
i not thought not to this which was happen by the following.
the exposed of three professionals of the speciality, the the the the clothing of characters and a seminar on this which. is on place.
and this will worse.
more we aroma of out final and more we expect of exercise practices and of information.
and even when it there has of in the samedis and dimanches it the the the is really the& the some the& the.
this time we have with the guideline alenka( the in it not the the the there has no boy) treaty of the way of the the the to the woman which not the the the has not of mensurations rules.
and of women of this type it the the the is the majority.
the the the the a has a small suffocating, the the the the another a body of boy, without we particular, a another the overweight.
the styliste must know how optiquement ammenuiser of arms broad, continue a suffocating or, rajouter of courbes necessary.
we are doing and to would joliment the heavyweights and also to not not to of way too voyante of types of women as jennifer lopez with a strong poitrine and of hanches as and a size with.
if the the the it there has by example a difference between the size and the hanches of such way that the jupes or the pantalons not happening not the all, this applies the coup of. the do do on able.
and you not the regretterez not because the the the the clothing which- impeccablement is invaluable.
in a jupe on able you you sentirez many better that in the which glisse in permanently, if the the the enroule and not but not to the belt and and of following.
for those which have a if male have can. afford a clothing of lifestyle tucker, with of several of tissue cousus, or, still of broderies.
it there has course many of the the the examples of the the the apparences various and i am only that i the the the i any the week for trier all the information received.
but i the the the i also fear that the the the had we to this that i must do to the house it there in has too.
every stagiaire reçut a fame to to for the day and the single.
we must take in account the the the the if current, the type of fashion of the personality and that its if.
i devrai the& the to the& the miranda kerr, that perhaps you know of the campaign the secret of victoria.
the substance of me, this i fact pleasure, because it the the the is better that of the the the to britney spears, christina aguilera which has taken almost% kilograms these the time( not take not my statement, svp, completely the seriously) or, the young selena gomez.
we must as and quilts to from of magazines or seek on internet, imprimer and work the graphisme.
the moodboard, as we said for the result final, expressed our lifestyle staff and that our relationship with the creation graphically.
think also on the part graphically the styling is also important.
the styliste not the the the habille not and only the physical but creates by example the pages relationships in the magazines( on of products donnés the tendencies for the bags to hand, the manteaux, etc ...).
mario kamenik, styliste and graphiste, we has nurtured of all this.
but this, ... until the the the the sunday
the styliste must have a vision general
three from of the speciality have given a aspect diverse to the sitting of saturday full of the the the information on the different types of characters.
honza pokorny, styliste, jakub polanka graphiste of fashion and ben renc, fate of fashion.
jakub we has was that the fashion is a illusion and the styliste should know the the the the use.
and a styliste of talent knows work with a only clothing of way different.
the variabilité is for this example an.
as by example this trench-coat which. must of the the the be of of way classic with a jean and a t-shirt as a coat included but also it can to also the body soul, with of escarpins and the take in photo as a robe.
or, it enough of there the manches or the against and have immediately a new look.
the& the jouez with this the& the he out.
but i the the the i particularly valued the council with: the& the for the work you have need of know the rules perfectly the& the.
the& the you can then start to there contrevenir the& the, has said jakub.
finally i understand why we if the the the best of the the the learn these rules, what do with, to what, why, then that in the magazines of fashion we has sometimes something thing of the the the another.
no statement on the défilés of fashion.
i know of new, thanks the fate of fashion ben that the styliste must have many more of variantes of the the the clothing that those which are photographiées.
it the the the is to say that for fashion story which will a ten of pages( therefore a ten of models) i must be ready to in the& the retailler the& the the less a quinzaine.
and also, a vêtement and its combination with of the the the other elements so completely differently that the the the in reality.
we must be with this the in of the the the a creation of the the the a model.
the fact that the the the the image and the lifestyle are sometimes the half the succés we has been confirmed by honza pokorny.
it enough of look madonna which not the the the is not a- s but its image and the marketing in have fact a star world.
in polish-czech, the the the the approach to the the the the use of services of stylistes still still frileuse.
and the t known the consider sometimes as unnecessary( it enough that i as something thing but this that i parais is the second which).
and if someone the the the a. fact do a styling of our on, we must then be on the fact that the the the it we dicte with a great over a size completely different( more small) that the that the the the it has in reality.
it we still then that the the the to naviguer on google and if the the the ensure if the infos of boulevard are state of the fame in question, if it has maigri or grossi etc ...
honza and mario we have asked sunday on the heart that the the the it not enough not the styliste of if the the the targeted in the fashion and know assembler of models.
it must communicate with the people that the the the it habille and it is and important of the the the be a good psychologist.
know tell the people, not not. flatter, keep its opinion.
the& the when a manager you request of him trier its cupboard and the fill of new elements you not can not all throwing and him say, my god what horror. the& the
the& the you will few affairs that you will with and him that you conseillerez with what the be the& the, said mario.
it we has shown what this that must all contain this that the the the the we called the the& the placovka the& the or vichy the styliste.
it the the the is that that you accrochez around of the size and that you have on course for all this which you have need.
furthermore the things clearly defined as the ciseaux, the rouleaux for dépilation or, still the épingles to nourrice, we there is also the over of nylon( that the styliste use for secretly of products as of bags, or, of chapeaux), of clips special with which we firm a vêtement in the backs, if the the the it is too great( the the the the épingle or another type of the the the agrafe not are not utlisables because they could abîmer the vêtement) or, a kit of designer.
for that we soyions not only of people which listening but which have tried something thing of way practice they we have happily how ressemeller properly of shoes.
and the in of the sitting photo in the the the the workshop where the surface is compassion, the semelle could if the the the abîmer, to times to lextérieur.
and and we have collé and collé.
we not the the the had not the right of affect the ciseaux for not not. behaving by inhalers.
it must therefore really of competences.
mario i the the the has fact pleasure when the the the it i the the the has congratulated for my creation.
the comptence which i am state not the the the is not for my copine.
this is only a small summary of this that we have learned the in the second weekend of in
i thing of more in more to understand that do the styling a profession not the the the is not a promenade in a screen of roses, that everyone in count this that the the the it wants.
the need of speed the run. shafik to through any the the the the america.
review
has the the the the origin a race without problem. become to because of the the the a together of the the the errors mindless of people which not the the the in have nothing to do in a its matinal routinier the work.
this role until the the the to a some able the the the the ambition of everyone but this not is to nothing if person not the the the has to of do something thing of more.
the new part sous-titrée; run has product of large expectations before its opt-out.
it secure of take a new direction with the series of race need for speed already old and of out a ensure of game to from of parties jouables which not. will not only with of points.
we were therefore curious how will be the passages rajoutés the in fought the heroes main fate of its car and fact this that the the the it has to.
as this. fact already in the series nfs, the result is completely another that this that the the the the we atttendait.
this are potentially of games of race of the the the arcades but the the the the together has to the low to because of few reproduce unnecessary which exist already since several years.
this not are not really of errors but rather the the the the expression of the the the a fainéantise incomprehensible of the on of développeurs.
the the the the embarked thing very,.
you are taken in the the the the embarked which the heroes main jack has of problems caractériels and for the to. the to part to of shopping illegal to through the the the the america.
you you asseyez behind the vatanen on the coast west to san virgin and your mission is of the the the happen the first to new york.
the the the the idea has of elements interesting.
the the the the agenda is divided in ten stages and then in more of 50 shopping.
this which in result that every race. fact on a another agenda and the stages more in of environnements different which. distinguent enough, the each of other and are interesting.
the his not the the the has not the feel a only at that the game him proposes something thing of the the the same.
some environnements are of surcroit enough jolis even if the level technical graphically is the even type that the analyses previous.
finally this not the the the is not the end the world.
but the conduct to through the desert, in of landscapes of the the the autumn or, in of mountains highly enneigées is very pleasant visuellement.
the épreuves are in more of time in time agrémentées of the the the a élement creutzfeldt-jakob.
by example in the desert you you surroundings in a storm of grit which you is of way sensitive the visibility.
then in the mountains you must do attention to this that the the the a avalanche not you- not on.
has on of this the different shopping are, agencées the antagonise behind the other.
it not the the the there in has only that the the the a small number but this enough.
it there of moment you you efforcez of surpasser the number asked of the the the adversaries( as in a race classic) then you courrez against the shows( duel classic with the chronomètre) and then still you waiting a another duel with a opponent.
of time in time you have also the police which between in the game and which to of you to the situation dificile.
the counterfeiting are the passages outside vehicle.
it if the the the is rather of the the the una animation interactive when the most the time jack if the the the runs before someone the the the a and you must the the the the help in tapant on the good pressing the good at.
nothing of complicated.
this which is surprising it the the the is that the the the it there has less of times of this type that this that you answers( for be concrete it not the the the there in has that three).
the result it the the the is, as this because this part not risk not of embarrassing and. place, in the context describes above, in the elements which agrémentent the game.
the model of conduct is in the tradition of games previous.
this which means that the the the currently it not the the the there has nothing of the the the extraordinary but we not can not say that this be negative.
for this which concerns the simulation realistic you rooms go see,.
but, that the the the the we can find better in the conccurrence the model of conduct will very, with the type of design of shopping.
therefore all is ok.
the problems starting to country after a some time.
has the diffférence the model of conduct, that of collisions not the the the is not still the point.
we not the the the are not of this game a misrepresentation get and of collisions, but when you not the the the have not, at of the the the a severity with not the the the any what subject, the any idea of the way which. has your auto, this not the the the is therefore not completely good.
the in of exceedances schedule you you touchez quelquefois know-how slightly but other your auto on in of voltiges folles.
or,. at in likened.
thanks the system of redémarrage this not the the the is not really a problem but this you emphasize really.
the redémarrage. fact of way to this that when you you are cassé the one or you are out in the décor the game you ramène the at the last point on the the the the agenda.
but you not have only that of 5 redémarrages.
when you have used the 5 redémarrages you must recommencer the game since the beginning.
it the the the is therefore more a tool, for the case where something thing not. is not as it must, that quelquechose on which you can really be.
quelquefois the redémarrages not the the the help not and it must find the solution in. remémorrant of memory the piece of the the the agenda in question.
the great hic of this game it the the the is that the same actions. are in the same places.
by example it there has some virages that the the the it must to of the the the a some way otherwise this not is not.
other you anywhere on a place given of vehicles the& the civilians the& the always in the even practice that you arriviez first, fifth, 5 seconds in ahead or a minute in delay.
this which the in angry this are the situations when you see to easily the the the the opponent between two cars from in sense opposite and when you congestion, you, it you must be. to of on and the conturner or, slow.
it the the the is equal if you will au-devant of him because it the the the is the& the on-call the& the of such way that for the situation data it sometimes always all almost of your would.
the adversaries have still of the the the other benefits.
for all the time the game, you, you congestion in some places, to new without. feeling the time, and you have always the even opponent which you run-up the even place.
this énerve the more in end of game when you unlucky on a long-term bridge in sense opposite.
the the the the opponent must to all price to before you.
when it is before you it you behind the view of other vehicles in sense opposite and you into in severity a good number of time.
we can understand that the aim of this game is of do something thing of captivant and full of the the the adrédaline, but it is clear that you you ennuyez quickly.
and it the the the is happens because the through of the the the a model of conduct simple the game is interesting and the places with as of the the the action that you not the the the have not the time of follow all this which. is.
and it the the the is equal if it the the the is to because the concept of 50 routes contact, that the the the the order of shopping is such that the the the it not the the the there has no chance of if the the the bore or, something thing of the the the another.
the the the the idea original is the change of car the in of shopping.
you must do attention to dispensing to essence on the routes because you can there change of car however the most the time the that you have you enough.
the cars are divided in three categories.
the cars of sport are ideal for the cities, the major cylindrées american for the motorways droites and the- cars of sport to atours unmanageable on the- very technical by example on the roads in lacet in the mountains.
and the fashion of challenges, which are of shopping in of places individuals that you know of the the the the embarked, will very, with the regime main of the the the the history.
you recevez not only of médailles but also of points of the the the experience which if the the the top to your profile which is common to challenges and to the the the the embarked.
when you have reached the more high level of driver, different objects starting to. déverrouiller:
it. connecte any with the office autolog which between other compare your results it with those of the the the other players and you procurent of the the the other functions in the community.
the the the the a of by the more difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of the the the the embarked.
you congestion with your car in the tunnel the tube( it like) where you unlucky in the the the the dark on the paths( it like).
your indicator of speed you made between 150 and 200 km/ at( to preconceived) and behind you sometimes a rame of tube which you discounts the car directly to the scrap.
has the inconsistent we have had a debate for few days to know if someone the the the a has really will at of the creation of this game or, if the authors we are really for of imbéciles.
the part technical the game not the the the is not extra, but the part visual is in rule general pleasant and in some case really-.
this which new-slot it the the the is that in of situations more extreme, the the the the display not but not the level and in some case of way tragic.
this concerns especially the accidents with a great number of participants when a display fluide not you is more to nothing.
the part pose is good and the runway is the choice.
in the aim of please the more great number and particularly the more the young public a new runway pose has been created in the lifestyle the& the i mixture all the& the, but we can if the the the wait to this that person not the the the achètera the game for the music.
impression general of need for speed: the run is therefore really messy.
if the game not the the the had not these mindless errors we could say without fear that the the the it if the the the is of the better production of nfs these last years.
but this game gives the the the the impression of not not be started.
the the the the amusement is really, but préparez you to this that the reproduce you tapent in the eyes with the force of the the the a réflecteur of the the the aérodrome.

history of the the the a mark:
the the the the innovateur ibm thing the second century of its existence
if someone the the the a to seek the vocable which expressed the more almost the strategy ibm, the more closest would the& the the long-term term the& the.
for a broad public ibm is the symbol of the revolution technological, is a firm masse as very current and however since its creation it if the the the is appearing% years.
the basis of this strategy to long-term term has been jetée by the first head of the firm, the visionary thomas j. watson sr.
it has left this slogan that the the the a great number of problems global can be réglés for little that the people are willing of think.
its slogan the& the think the the the! the& the is become the the the the an around of which will. develop the life of the the the a future mega-player( and also the as the magazine internal that ibm commença to published in 1935).
it the the the was the basis of the culture of the the the the company soignement developed by watson.
for we ibm means a thought to long-term term of movements care political to the future.
ibm has survived% years thanks the fact that the the the it our always do to its values of basis and however not the the the has not had fear of change all the other around of the the the it.
this we has allowed the in of our first century of into the technology, the business and the society.
we hope that in the second century we reuniting still more the& the has délaré for the the the the anniversary the the the the current director of the firm samuel j. palmisano.
a system, prepared
watson, in the years 30,. cooking to if the the the after of its employees as bata in republic czech- the people of ibm were the only among the first employees americans to have the holiday terrible, a insurance gifts by the the the the employer more a uniform of the the the ran splendid and a system, member of récompenses for the inventeurs and the commmerciaux.
of the even way ibm has a sytème of relations with the customer, member.
the society was the beginning géniale in the discovery of talents- as the the the the a of first companies to have aboli any form of discrimination and could and have the choice.
the plan current is completely in the the the the spirit of the strategy anti-discriminatoire since this will a femme- virginia rometty- which should replace palmisano to the head of the the the ibm.
this working home ibm since 30 years and for currently the post of head of at, marketing and of the strategy.
ibm the in of last years fact this that the the the the we called the jamy, the brain- storming in line to from of what are from many of strategies future and of innovation.
it not the the the is not should that the the the it has many of the the the ideas- in the firm it there has almost of 500000 people which work.
a institution with a good name
it the the the is the the the the image internal and external of the the the the company which him refute a position sure in the areas of affairs.
the& the since the beginning ibm had a concept rather of the the the institution that of the the the a firm technological the& the, said rosabeth moss kanter, professor of the the the economy to the the the the ecole of the the the economy of harvard and author the paper on ibm.
the& the ibm not the the the is not a firm technlogique but a firm which aid to solve of problems the world the business in using its technology the& the, ajoutait geogre colony of the firm of consulting forrester research.
as the said the firm itself it there has a difference between enter on the market and create this market.
ibm- or, the the& the great blue the& the, as it if the the the called- to states united had we to its slogan- in% years it has grew until the the the to become the the the the a of more large companies world.
it the the the is course the firm technological the more polyvalente- it growing of software, of hardwares, infrastructure, sanitation, services of council the level of products the server until the the the to the nanotechnology.
it has of many patent of all the companies propellants american and five of its employees have received a price nobel.
among its discoveries. squarely by example the beverages of tickets, the card of payment, the swap financial, the code bar or, the disquette.
ibm if the the the is dignity. this year with 220 billion of dollars the second more great firm technological according the capitalisation the market( the first is apple), when for the first time it dépassa in 1996 microsoft.
realised in ahead
this not are not all the innovation and fabrications which have had the preference the customer and of the the the the time- ibm by example not the the the has not succeeded the gamble on a system operational own bones/ 2, the service prodige in line or, of the the the the computer ibm pcjr:
the& the has from the at where your business is bâti on the movement in ahead you not can not émotionellement remain stuck on the past, the& the fact out samuel j. palmisano.
for this ibm not the the the has not of problem for build its for on many of platforms and when they not work not it if the the the in will.
has the difference by example the conccurent microsoft which to the basis. but and still under the system operational you.
a technology perspective
in the income ibm, the services, which are trained for a fifth by the software and hardwares, have a place cooling.
however still in 1990 it was with more of the motié of participation the more very representative of hardware.
has from of the the the the year 2000 ibm has sold of active to low at for 15 billion of dollars, the in of cettre period it has invested hopkins billion of dollars in the the the the purchase of technologies prospects.
it still in investment and even to from of 2008, when for the first time it has surpassé the new crisis financial.
ibm he according the precepts of its first head thomas j. watson, which the in of the great crisis economic has also increased its volume of the the the investment.
it transpires now that ibm is the crisis current without be inquiétée?
the price of the the the the action ibm has progessé to from of 2008 in rocket of 120 cross-compliance, the benefit net of the firm still to still.
the logo of the firm ibm is of change all but not its values.
we can if the the the wait for this to this that this mega-player flexibly maitrise of the the the other crises.
history of the the the ibm: has from of tranches of cheese until the the the to flights in the cosmos.
the society ibm( international business machines) is was to new york it there has% years the it had initially the name complicated of computing tabulating recording corporation.

the worst vices of women: this you concerns also?
if you ask to men of determine of vices unprofitable of women, all, the each as the other, are able of the out the& the of their channel the& the.
my expensive homework, you will know in the lines will of vices mutilation which arrive to pomper the blood of veines of men.
the shopping
your half you fact of remarks that you are dépendante of shopping?
must you you buy the less a vêtement by week?
you are only of the the the buy and by packets the at of balances?
in your case we can about of shopping as a language-bound.
some women think that the the the they should product their passion of do of shopping.
but you direz, which résisterait the lèche-vitrine of shops of clothing, to seek for oneself of jolis clothing and then the try all in cabine( the the the the ideal of colours different)?
and, that for the most of women buy be a hobby, this can become for the the the the human a real hell.
forgotten you only how of time have you said to your joint that the the the it attende to the the the the entry ...
insatisfaction constant
the& the i not am not too biggest the& the?
the& the i the the the would need of maigrir the less of 5 kilograms- i would start to do the sport? the& the
the& the i you plais? the& the
these phrases not you rappellent-elles not something thing?
yes?
you are therefore part of these women which are obsédées by their if.
this not the the the is not the question that you should stop of you after of yourself but a great number of the the the men is allergique the fact that their partner be always in is of. complaining of its if.
the sex very not the the the hesitate not to say that more the presence of these complaints is and more the women increasingly empoisonnantes.
the the the the odre and the propreté to the first place
it the the the is as a sometimes infinitely.
wash the drain, to the the the the aspirateur, up the soil, do the dust, décaper the room of blocked- and this two time by week.
you are of remarks to your partner that the the the it that with of feet comment on the soil own, to children that the the the they have sali the lavabo, encrassé the vitre of the room of residence, and that this you gives many of work?
the case where you souffrez rightly of this obsession, try of the the the have to the the the the spirit that the the the it not must nothing exagérer and that the the the the order and the propreté not must not be to the first place in the family.
this desire inoffensif of propreté can however spoil your relations and even the peace family.
the work of sape

if you are on your partner this work of sape of this way several time by day, you will really the décomposer.
it is obvious that you not that not to it you want that all be-.
perhaps that if the men the were, the women not the the the would not to do as of work of sape ...
the insult, the persiflage
the insult, the persiflage but also the insultes against someone the the the a are also the own of some women.
the women are any particularly to relations and and are contentes of with of issues as which, where, with which, how and why.
perhaps that each of we leaves evade a small persiflage inoffensif here and that.
the hand on the heart it the the the is yet a unusual of women.
but the worse are those which conseillent, persiflent, even unelected the other and are for their round- particularly the work in a collective of women- particularly dangerous.

how have buzzword the price of travel since 1989
until the the the in 1989 it there had in czechoslovakia only 5 agencies of travel of the the the state: cedok, sporturist, ckm, rekrea and autotourist.
the agencies of travel to this time proposaient of travel especially in the countries the bloc socialist, because the travel to the the the the west were very they.
the tourists czechs found for the holiday in germany of the the the the is, union soviet( sotchi, potemkin and sea black), in bulgaria, romania( the two in sea black) and in hungary( balaton).
a great exception for the period of judgements to 1972 when it was that of travel in yugoslavia then the regime commença to have a inclination for the the the the west and the travel to the yugoslavia were very they for the tourists czechs.
the great paradox of the the the the time socialist was that the the the it nétait not that for the citizens the bloc socialist( also for the tchécoslovaques) of travel individually even in the framework of countries socialists.
in the case where the citizen tchécoslovaque he travel individually by example in poland or in union soviet it him we a letter of the the the invitation otherwise the travel individual not the the the was not that.
the agencies of travel to this time offraient also of travel to the the the the west however it we do the queuing any the night with a vichy of couchage or, have a the& the good knowledge the& the the in of the the the the agency of travel.
and even after this this not the the the was not still won.
the the the the agreement for the currencies which was the condition for travel to the the the the west was refused to people the& the political incorrects the& the which not can not the all travel.
the currency tchécoslovaque not the the the was not however échangeable and it not the the the was not possible of the the the to of means financial without the the the the agreement of currencies( currency western) for travel to the the the the west.
the czechs bagnoli the more often their holiday in the countries where it there had by therefore of many houses of campaign and chalets that the czechs if the the the achetaient and this usual hard until the the the to now.
the travel of czechs have since known since 1989 a great revolution.
, that until the the the in 1989 the holiday in germany of the the the the is and bulgaria were the maximum, the czechs have past the the the the year last to the the the the abroad 4 million of days of holiday in the countries the world over.
the great paradox which we not the the the have not awareness today the the the today it the the the is that the countries the more popular is the croatia where it not the the the was not possible of the the the go freely until the the the in 1989 because part of the yugoslavia of the the the the time.
the removal of visas in the years 90 the century last in the countries neighbours of the the the the west have caused a huge wave of visits of short period especially in austria to vienna and in germany.
the tchécoslovaques not can not for long travel by air to the the the the west that everyone he see the less a at.
by example to paris the organisations of travel claimed sleep the czechs in of shanty in the parks because our income not we permettaient not of pay the the the the hotel or a pension.
the part typical of the the the a travel of czechs was to this time of the the the prevail with course its own food conserves, strings, etc ... for paper-saving.
a another at important has been also the the the the interchangeabilité of the krona czech which has allowed to our tourists finally after of tens of the the the years of power freely buy of the currency western.
our level of life and that the wage way have increased this which has caused around of the the the the year 1997 a another at important.
thanks to a request growing for the travel the agencies of travel have started since 1997 to prepare of towers with of valley by charters air which thanks to of contracts have formidablement reduced the costs by report to this that the the the it there had before.
has the end of years 90 the century last the czechs had of valley without visas with almost the most of countries developed the world over to on the had which more later have have our travel.
a another at interesting in the the the the history the tourism post-révolution, when was prepared the first charter air to a countries private, the thailand, to from of the republic czech.
since this year as every year of charters air direct emmènent of tourists czechs in the lointains countries chauds the this winter it there will 12 destinations unmanageable to from of the republic czech.
it the the the is more of 100000 czechs which proud the countries unmanageable every year!
still a at interesting in this period which nutshell our development post-révolution is has in 2008.
the 17 november 2008 the had have have the visas for the tourists czechs and has allowed to our countries of. refuse completely in the group of countries developed.
in 2008 also the czechs for the first time in the the the the history have past more of the half of their holiday to the the the the abroad( 50, 3%) and for the first time still in the the the the history have spent more of 15 000 sek by person for of holiday to the the the the abroad there including the charges annexes. sek by person.
the the the the house general must find its president but this risk of. finish by a situation without solution the& the a for the& the
almost of 5mois already the football czech is without president and it risk that the successeur of the the the ivan hasek to the head of the the the the association the football of the republic czech not be not still known after still a house general which must. place thursday to nymburk.
however it not the the the there always not of the the the agreement according what regulation of vote it must deal.
without this agreement it not the the the is not possible of start to vote for the the the the a of three candidate.
jindrich rajchl, miroslav pelta and tomas paclik are interested by the direction the football czech.
hasek has given its resignation in june and the in of its starting has called its colleagues has if the the the unite and find a strong personality which dirigera the football in the future.
only for the the the the era after hasek the football is income in backwards to of differences between the chambers of the the the the association which not can not. to of the the the agreement on a candidate common.
this if the the the is completely shown the 16 september when the the the it we choose a new president.
the delegated of the the the the house general. are together unnecessary in the house national to prague because the negotiations is has negation and it not the the the has even not been question of with of the way of the the the having.
it not the the the there not had of the the the agreement on the fact of know which has the right of vote to the the the the house general- only, particularly, the representatives statutaires or, also the officials investis of full powers.
in this single point it there has had a agreement part-time since this at with the the the the aid also the office for the the the the state and the right, according which the representation on the basis the full power not the the the is not possible.
the differences still always to about the regulation for the the the the election.
it is too clear that the committee executive, which in its negotiations planifiées or extraordinary, not the the the has nothing made not more to the situation
the views on the possibilitě of vote have changed several time but the point névralgique still always the even.
the question is: how deal for the third turn for not not do in the for.
the& the the potato of discord lies in the fact with: be deal according the statuts or, find a another model the& the, was the the the the a of three front of the the the the association the football of the republic czech dusan svoboda which represents the football professional the in of the the the the association.
according the rules the model provided is the third turn that of candidate which will received the more of votes in percentage the in of the house for which it is candidate.
the moravie is ready according this that the the the the we said to. from for that is the candidate which will received the more great percentage of votes of two chambers.
and the part czech on the condition that the victor should have the two third the less of percentage of votes.
the& the only this would lose then the the the the idea of two towers previous and this would refuse completely the concept bicaméral the& the, valid svoboda which includes the objections of the part morave and according which the better would of not not change the regulation and vote according the statuts in force.
it the the the is surprising that tomas paclik be also of the the the agreement even if the the the it estimated that the regulation of elections established according the statuts advantage the more pelta among all the candidate.
the& the i wish that the the the the we vote the maximum according the statuts of the the the the association the& the.
the& the for that the the the it not the the the there has not still of the the the ideas saugrenues imaginées by a representative as the in of assemblées general being the& the, has said the owner of victoria plzen which is candidate for the first time and which in its exposed if the the the is defined especially against pelta.
pelta still optimistic.
according him to nymburk it there will a new president and believes that the candidate coopèreront in the future together and of way constructive.
the& the the lone possible today the the the today in championship of the the the europe should we all the world the& the.
the& the the football will to new on a wave of fortunately and it there aure more of the the the entrain for a cooperation the& the add the the the the officer of jablonec which among the three has the more great experience in on of direction the football as professional that the the the the level regional.
rajchl is more pessimiste.
the& the i believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very strained the& the.
the& the this not the the the is not a problem between the czechs and the moraves, but it there has of tendencies to to change the regulations to skilled the& the.
the& the this can cause to new a blockade to the the the the assemblé general the& the.
the& the i the the the hope all of even that the; reason win the& the has said rajchl.
it not still not many of time for a agreement common to all the parties.
some réuunions should have place directly the montenegro but which can say if any the direction the football will complete for the game.
the flight specifically affrété in which had travel until the the the to podgorice between other the front dalibor kucera and rajchl, not the the the has not décollé for of reasons technical and we cherchait a variante for take a part the committee executive on the ground of reprisals.
has the end it the the the is the meeting ministerial, which could have place wednesday, which should be depends.
the minister of the the the the education of the young and of sports darkness dobes would very happy of receive the parties déchirées the in of the the the the association trainers the more strong the countries and the union to a agreement.
in the game it there has many: a contributions étatique, the credibility the football and also the the the the house general of the the the the union czech of sports which must determine the direction the sport czech after the problems financial of sazka.
paclik if the the the in will the fighting for the post of president because it not has no candidate correct.
if the head of pronk of plzen tomas paclik had seen before the the the the house general which the profile have answered to all this that the the the it request for a new president of the the the the association the football of the republic czech( afrt) it not would not set in campaign for this high office.
the& the if a such candidate there i the the the the depends, i fight for him and i not i there not to the the the the election. the& the
the& the but in the situation current it not the the the has not been possible of find a such candidate the& the, has said paclik to the the the the agency of press czech( ctk).
the motivation of paclik is of the the the enter in competition with miroslav pelta and jindrich rajchl for rightly try of the the the prevent pelta of the the the access to the head of the the the the afrt which to preconceived would given potemkin for this election.
paclik would also that the the the the case where it remporterait the elections it take this post of president only until the the the in 2013 year will for a house general.
it verrait, in the office a manager expérimenté and of high level but which not the the the is not linked with the world the football.
the& the i the the the i discussed with of people which would the profile the& the, he.
the& the for me this has been terrible when some i the the the have said that the the the they not did not be identifiés with the football czech in this at. the& the
the& the i the the the like do change this image the& the, he added.
this which, assess, new-slot especially paclik, it the the the is the relationship between pelta and the president of the the the the union regional the football of plzen pianist berbr, human to the importance contreversée which is known in the boomerang as lobbyiste able of the the the influer on the vote of delegated the the the the the the the assemblé general.
for paclik it not the the the is not acceptable that pelta for this position of president.
the& the if the the the it gagnait, the the the the state current demeurerait and it not the the the there have nothing of new in the football. the& the
the& the and with the the the the support of berbr, which is a commerçant of high flight, this would still less favour the football the& the, has- paclik.
this which the choque still it the the the is the fact that the name of pelta has been; it there few years the in of the the the écoutes in the framework of the the the a investigation on a case of corruption, for which pelta if the the the in is out without no penalty.
the& the i not know not what prestige pelta upside the football. the& the
the& the and how can considered to eyes of the the the the uefa and of the fifa the& the said paclik, which has said it there has something time the& the if pelta becoming president, i vends the club of plzen the& the.
in the case where paclik triompherait the vote of thursday, it should prove that the the the it could cooperate with felta.
rajchl, a another candidate which had been supported by paclik before the the the the house general of september which had ended by a fiasco, think the even thing.
the& the it( pelta) would the first with which i the the the comments the& the.
the& the it has of large capabilities the& the
the& the it would able of. present by example as head of the representation the& the.
the& the but as manager of the the the the association it not would not able. the& the
the& the i not wary not the would in this that i not know not the& the, made paclik which in september has eu a great attention when it if the the the is; for the the the the cancelled of the commission of referees with ludek macela that the the the has aftertaste dagmar damkova.
paclik states that the the the it would the level for should the the the the association.
it takes as example its capabilities to should of companies private and that the the the it is also since the the the the year last the club of plzen which has fêté with its support in may last its triomphe in first division.
the& the i the the the i the force for do change something thing in the world the sport and for there to a some culture the& the.
the& the i freinerais the the the the influence of some groups interested which have by example trend to influer on the commission disciplinaire and of the the the appeal, this which brings to of situations of bad feel the& the, has added paclik which not chache not its antipathie for the head the sparta daniel kretinsky.
it envisagerait also a harmonisation of relations with the committee olympic czech which the power of lobby with of political of high level would of the the the to for the sport more of the the the money of the the the the impôt on the games.
the& the it the the the is a of points key which the new president should if the the the after the& the.
the& the if the the the it if the the the is of the tax on the games of chance as the say the parties political, i understand their argumentations but they should also say where will the the the the money the& the, he said.
paclik not takes not its liaison current with the club of plzen as something thing of negative even if himself states that the president of the the the the afrt should be the& the above of parties the& the.
pelta is of new linked with jablonec and rajchl with dukla of prague.
the& the this not the the the is not the the the the ideal the& the.
i not see not of reason of to my actions the club of plzen to someone the the the a if i must return a year and half after the& the, has said paclik.
pelta has promised of new statuts for the the the the afrt which should to end to situations of for.
two days before the the the the house general of the the the the association of football the the the the a of candidate to the presidency miroslav pelta has promised that if the the the it is elected, the the the the afrt will of new statuts which should to end in the future to; to about the regulation for the elections.
the official of jablonec is before the meeting of thursday to nymburk very optimistic and think that the succés today the the the today of the representation of football should we this guéguerre before the vote.
pelta before the the the the election of september which not if the the the is not carried has promised rightly of. spend to the representation national and to the the the the obtain of means financial if the the the it is elected.
it if the the the is decided to be candidate the last at just before the the the the house general last and this delay of two months could, him afford of defend its vision of the direction the football and of the present in a broad context.
the& the the people to all the levels are the football since long and expect that thursday it there has a president the& the.
the& the they feel that it the the the is the best at for that someone the the the a this the direction of the the the the association the& the, ajoute-t-il, but it is before all linked with the club of jablonec, has worked a great number of the the the years the sparta and the committee executive of the the the the union.
it the the the is also for this that the the the it has enough of the the the experiences for should the football czech.
it is convinced that behind the problems current with the the the the election. is a euphorie which evident to lépoque of the the the ivan hasek.
the& the unfortunately to the the& the assemblé general of june of statuts have been approved which not the the the were not parfaits as all if the the the in are aperçus the& the.
the& the if the the the it not the the the there had not all these various interprétattions we have already had a president since september the& the, would pelta.
it the the the is rightly the review the document the more important of the the the the association civic which has taken any the the the the attention of delegated.
the& the if i deviens president, i the my as mission personal and am ready to in take all the responsibilities in the case where this not that not the& the.
the& the it the the the is a principle without which we not can not exist the& the, has added pelta.
then it if the the the best, assess, of not not. confronter to its adversaries.
it has said by that the the the it can cooperate with jindrich rajchl that the the the it reconnait had we to its training in right and that the the the it knows knows that its adversaire-candidat would its first vice-president.
it not the the the has not not more attacked since long tonas paclik which the contrary not the the the stop not of- pelta.
the& the it evolved in the football since a year and has already had few succés. the& the
the& the its attacks not the the the were however not of more honourable and has surprise of many people the in of the campaign. the& the
the& the it the the the is also for this that some have now of doubts on its nature the& the, has said pelta to the the the the address of its opponent but still, he, do to proclamations that the the the it has are in september.
its weapon the more strong is according him its knowledge the football to from of sports the more low level until the the the to the réprésentation national.
this should be a vitirne the football.
the& the and i i the the the efforcerais also of finish all the affairs which starting with the of bohémians or, the following the scandal of corruption. the& the
the& the i the the the entrerais immediately in negotiations with the sector public and private for that we able to enough of the the the money for all the football the& the, has said to the the the the agency of press czech ctk the 46ème candidate it there has two months.
it has also added that its appointment to the head the football not the the the amènerait no change of people.
the& the i would do knowledge with all the employees the& the, he said to strahov where is a comprehensible starts since that the the the it not the the the there not of direction.
, that the the the it there has of scénarii cuts outstanding with the the the the house general, it think that the delegated not the the the heating not to nymburk for nothing.
the& the if the the the it there has a only point of discord on the way of vote the third turn we methodological to the surpasser the& the.
the& the the football has need of credibility and it not the the the the obtiendra that when the the the it there will to its head a new leader the& the, as the says of way optimistic pelta two days before the day probably depends for its career of official.
rajchl promises that under its direction the the the the afrt commencerait to work heavy
the& the if the vice-president current jindrich rajchl is elected new president of the the the the association the football of the republic czech to the the& the house general of thursday this not occasion not to great number of people, parait-il.
rajchl promises however that in the case where it would elected we will to work heavy.
it wants of changes by and to the member the committee executive are responsible of different areas the football.
it has promised also of to the the the the case bohémians, improve the relations with the the the the uefa and the fifa, to the football more of the the the money and continue the work started by the predecessor ivan hasek.
the& the as president i want i the the the after the football in its over the& the.
the& the of contacts international with the the the the uefa and the fifa the through of the representation national, the football professional and of the the the a football highly for the young. the& the
the& the but i not say not that i shall all this only the& the has said rajchl in a maintenance for ctk.
the& the i am a his of the the the team and want distribute the competences the in the committee executive order that everyone of member if the the the for of the the the a area powers. the& the
the& the and i distribuerai of missions difficult for that the football face a great not in before the& the.
the& the many of people not will not to because it if the the the will of start to work heavy rather that of- the other the& the he added.
it has fact state, assess, that the the the it not. would not as candidate in reason of the the the a atmosphere criticism.
the& the has about of me, we knows that i working 20 hours by day. the& the
the& the but i the the the i need of know if this applies the coup and if i the the the allocation of people behind me which i mettront without an of way in the way and émettront of doubts on each of my actions the& the, explain why it hésitait.
the& the many of people i the the the have all of even said that i not must not up because they renonceraient also the& the.
the& the cest a confidence that i not can not trahir the& the, he.
this which the motive, assess, is also of continue the work started with hasek.
the& the since these two last years it there has had a great work of fact and i not want not the to do the& the.
the& the it there has of process which have been with which will of consequences in few years and i not the the the like not that someone the the the a the stop. the the the, he said with the fear that in the case of the the the the election of miroslav pelta the situation the in of the the the the union not return as it was before hasek.
the& the i believe to a work systematic and it the the the is a thing that mirek pelta not knows not do the& the.
the& the behind him. are of people which fairaient the football of such way that the the the it would only for those which have been choose the& the.
the& the we can i reproach a some number of things but certainly not of bear quelq the the the a the& the.
the& the i i the the the best of the the the be objective the& the.
the& the i want do the football for all because all the world in will content not only those which have been choose
and it confirms to new that the the the it would only a president for the polish-czech.
the& the and if the the the it there in has which say the contrary, i am ready to do the maximum for the moravie the& the.
the& the by example, it the the the is the time of the the the consider that the second division be divided in two parties the the the the a czech and the the the the another morave which the vainqueurs. retrouveraient in first division. the& the
the& the it not the the the there have not of situation as currently with only three team moraves in the division because the problem is currently of find of young players.
as tomas paclik, president the club of plzen, is entered in the competition for the post of president, rajchl not can assess its own chance of win.
the& the i sense in permanently a support of the house czech which i the the the has elected its language-bound -président and knows that the the the with me it there will of succés the& the, has said rajchl which considering among its future succés of the the the paper-saving of tens of million of sek on of contracts désavantageux, of negotiations of contracts with the vacuum and on the law on the games.
it said the contrary that the fact that the the the the association not be not united is a fault common to all.
then that the the the it said to about of pelta the& the that the the the it is disqualifié because with him the footblal czech they its credibility the& the, it think that the second opponent paclik is a candidate very which has of what offer the football.
the& the person not can to in doubt to plzen that the the the it has fact this year a magnificent work the& the.
the& the if the the the it was elected it kaczyński certainly in this which has been started by hasek and not would not of change notable among the people in the committees. the& the
the& the it not would not. spoil its succés the& the has said rajchl which has évaluait its rivals.
the more are swimming of the the the the europe
a motocross in the blue
of julia stanek
pataugeoires in preserving of the the the ovni, swimming magnifiques of budapest: which travel to through the the the the europe can live its work blue- and after have turned the city or fact a long promenade- can to with its evenings accustomed in of blocked of the the the water gazeuse.
a paper shows in what basin of were we can experience the more of welfare.
when iris meder was in travel of research for the 18 the months, it there has a subject which not should not miss in its baggage: its maillot of bathroom.
maximise on its backs in the the the the water, it observa the coupoles artistiquement arrangées, and nageait to the the the the against of marbres putten which the the the the awaited of the the the the another on of the piscine and not was of the the the relax the the the the art new méticuleusement continental of these swimming converties.
if a piscine controlled him was pleasure, it plummet in its carnet without by all the details look of the the the interest on the type of construction and on the the the the history the building.
more of 200 swimming have been sondées of this way by the the the the historienne of the the the architecture meder and it the have these in its paper already published: the& the badefreuden( concerned the bathroom the& the. the swimming one-size-fits-all municipal of münich, the palace of bathroom historical in the forests black, the& the buildings of concrete hardcore the& the in the taunus.
it has led its the& the travel to blocked the more quot of the the the the europe central the& the in 13 countries. to on of the the the the germany, the the the the austria and the switzerland, it has visited dimensions of places in italy, france, polish-czech, the slovakia, slovenia, hungary, romania, poland and a city in luxembourg, serbia and croatia.
the the the the german of 46 years is a real fervente of the culture the bathroom.
meder, explains that the the the it not the the the has not many of the the the interest for the sport but ell. feel eu to the the the the water of the the the a way completely different.
it the the the is irritant that the supporteurs of the were must. simply of nicer of carreaux bleus and if the the the accommoder of the puanteur of the the the the water of javel while that the joggers respirent the apos envoûtant of forests of the the the épicéa or can listen the gazouillement of the the the birds black-haired the park.
the& the i i am represented a day why the swimming must in fact be always if laides the& the has said the viennoise.
the& the i commençais therefore a where of beaux blocked. the& the
the surface of the the the the water strengthens doublement the the the the architecture
a drowned in a piscine and the huiles of sauna fridges- factor of welfare in the rooms of were are huge because that all the sense are éveillés, of the the the after meder.
and if the bâtisseurs. would donnés a little more of penalty, the rooms to swim could be a true délice for the eyes: the& the the place of the the the a three-month we has a surface of the the the water in the rooms of were. the& the
the& the it is of the the the a on ambiguous, but for of the the the a another on however the beauty the building all over. the& the
all the land. are optiquement of the the the a way double: of voûtes highest, carreaux multicolores, tremplins.
the volume of the the the image of small format the& the badefreuden the& the fact a report way of the the the interest of as pages on the the the the history of the the the architecture and of culture on the the the the one the welfare historic- it gives certainly to of do a motocross in the blue.
the collectionneuse meder has discovered of fifty-year-old remarkable during its research in hungary.
to on of blocked of welfare splendides as the bathroom széchenyi old of 100 years to budapest, it was of water containing the nitrate in a caverne natural in the karst( bathroom of caverne in miskolc-tapolca) and that the the the a bathroom of thermes which the than are including of the the the water containing of the the the the alcali and( városi termálfürdö in jászberény) and. pre-emptive in a building in form of horses.
by against, the swimming chauffées in full air of the switzerland and of austria offer of views lately. while that of the the the a roof the bathroom of zürich we has any the city to its eyes, we can relax the the the the arlberg enneigé to from of the the the a piscine external of st. anton: the bathroom turkish is muni of the the the a hang to from of which we can observe the the the the animation on the runway of ski.
perhaps the design of piscine the more extraordinary waiting the nageurs in längenfeld: the the the the aqua dome ötztal like to a ovni which has of the the the atterrir on the alps.
in winter, of the vapour if the the the there of three plateaux open, while that in the the the the arrière-plan if the the the accounting the mountains of the the the the ötztal to the sky.
alhambra in the forests black
the the the the smell of the the the the water of javel not the the the demands not of all the swimming of the where meder.
of many blocked thermiques overshadowed a smell of sulphur, of the the the the árpád-spa in the bekescsaba hungarian demands a strong smell of oil, that the the the it is difficult to believe, of. find in a spa health.
the the the the smell from of water alcalines therapeutic containing of the the the the hydrogen of carbon which is almost black and its limon you colle to the skin as that you you let get in the piscine- a experience of spa special.
during its gaining of a swimming, iris meder has also suffered of déceptions: when it he visit bad luhatschowitz, a piscine external free and in full air of the czechoslovakia, it if the the the is found before a ground van.
the bathroom designed by the the the the architèque dušan jurkovic in 1902 was meantime closed.
in jetant a coup of the the the naked by the hang of the the the the immeuble-art new in rouge-blanc-jaune, it has observed the the the the development of have weeds between the carreaux.
it has observed a indeed contrary in a charmante piscine in the forests black: the palace of thermes of bad wildbad.
this building has already survived three stages the we can find not only of elements néo-romains which outside since its design in 1844 but still a room maure in lifestyle alhambra which him has been added in 1900.
since its modernisation soigneuse of 1995, the palace spa still the bathroom potemkin of the the the the experte in piscine, iris meder- and not only because that the the the it is from of schwarzwald.
the& the it the the the is already a like at that of of savour styles of construction if different in a unity if we the& the, said meder.
with a such palace, the drowned in the piscine thermale is apparently only a question minor.

eve house to vienna
the flag which has déménagé
of the the the ingeborg wiensowski
a history of the the the architecture with of their, of low and a owned end: the flag austrian for the exhibitions world of brussels in 1958 has won of price, has been a museum to vienna, is left empty then is has in ruin.
to now it is to new open and but place of house of the the the exhibition.
if the the the the we if the the the enthusiasm for a architecture of the the the post-war modern, for its forms clear, its hangars in glass, its stories strong and audacieuses and its new materials of construction which are unprofitable of the croyance towards the progress technical, then the flag of the the the the you austrian proclaimed schwanzer for the the the the exhibition universal of brussels in 1958 in is a good and famous example.
the flag of schwanzer reçut once the the& the great price of the the the architecture the& the for its construction in steel and in glass, this and suspended.
the construction is considered until the the the to our days as a step important in the the the the architecture contemporary.
it has visited the architects if being, that the the the it has also built the flag for the the the the exhibition universal austrian following.
with its archipelago house to four cylindres of bmw and its construction adjacente in form of bol to munich, it is finally become famous the level international in 1973.
its project of flag in as that construction temporary had been legalise after the the the the exhibition universal in the screen switzerland to the station the south of vienna, has been has, and in judgements a museum the 20ème century has open-
but the building not the the the was or mentally or hautala appropriate for a museum- not of walls for accrocher the works of the the the art, therefore not a good environment.
however it has been also long used, until the& the to this that the the the the art kristen reçoive a new building to vienna.
since 2001 the building was empty and if the the the is of more in more worn.
to now the the the the you adolf krischanitz has has the flag, it is now the name of the& the house the eve century the& the and will to the the the the future used as museum for the the the the art kristen.
tuesday evening the museum belvédère has open, which the house s, the first exhibition- a coup of chance to all point of view.
the new starting has been they to, by agnès husslein-arco, which is become the new guideline in 2007 of the gallery austrian belvédère.
husslein-arco, has promu a historienne of the the the art to a career considerable between another in its young of patineuse artistic, by the following home sotheby the the the if, the museum guggenheim and in as that guideline fondatrice the museum of the the the the art modern of salzbourg, it has they particularly to, the work of into with of men political and of the protection of witness, it has did of funds public and of sponsorship private and in has established the the the the exploitation.
excepté the the the the art kristen, the works the sculpteur fritz wotruba which the foundation is the even name there have been exposed, a coffee and a champion if the the the there are, and a office must there be built.
surveillance stricter, small budget
for the being krischanitz was therefore the the the the interpreter ideal.
not only because that the the the it had has and widened with sensitivity the sécession of darkness olbracht and that the the the it had won the competition, but because that the the the it had studied to the the the the university technical of vienna and that for him the flag was the& the a place extremely important the& the place where it had seen the& the almost every weekend the& the the exhibitions.
it connaissait the project of the the the origin, and it connaissait the problems of the the the the building, which perdit in generosity and légèreté following to its its to vienna and of by its change of the the the use.
at of transformations current, it there when of carry problems: the the& the building was the& the a opening in energy the& the, said krischanitz.
the nutrient of drain of kerb in glass were changés, the glass isolant commission in fibres of glass was asked and the roof aftertaste by a glass of security particular.
the poutrelles of bridges thermiques have been states or replaced, and the revêtements including of the the the asbestos have been réhabilités.
two sous-sols have fact of the place to the new exploitation, a panel of light tamisé between the house and the road assure the the the the clarification, a bridge led to the the the the entry- it the the the is almost a new construction, but always the included flag schwanzer.
the doors external of the the the or are remained, the house is peinte in a georg protection against the rouille of colour rouge-brun.
and the room of cinema is even exactly same to this that the the the it was once.
and all this under close surveillance of authorities relevant for the witness and with a small budget.
the& the often of materials which are good and little gentlemen had be found, and which don also to the the the the office of the protection witness the& the, said krischanitz and it s the the the the attention on a soil gross in caucasus.
despite all the constraints, the problems and the transformations, the the& the building is left flexible and included.
this have been difficult with the flag, the& the which from of brussels the& the, has said krischanitz recently, a history typical of the& the drop-in-the-city the& the.
a such architecture. is the& the always the bad place the& the and wants despite all the& the dash the good awareness the& the.
but in this case the house the eve century not. is not the bad place, because if the the the it if the the the is of the the the a coup of chance of construction urban: around the screen switzerland. marketing rightly the the& the headquarters of the station central the& the all newly provided, with offices and flats.
and a another coup of chance will perhaps. produce: the house the eve century could be the renfort of the the the a another construction krischanitz, because the collectionneuse francesca von habsburg has bought the centre of the the the art temporary berlinois, and as it. said, it he already with the city order of the the the to a website in the neighbourhood the screen switzerland.

buffett had until the the the to now rather voicing the companies of technology.
it said that the the the it associated only in the companies which it includes the affairs.

the founder optimism his would a very good friend.
the threat is palpable
after the discovery of the the& the cell of zwickauer the& the the media turkish doubt of the the the the state of right german.
a newspaper about even of the the the a the& the ideology bloody the& the, which renaîtrait to now.
the murders of eight nationals turkish and of the the the a small company greek in the years 2000 to 2006 had a context extremist.
following to this new, the turkey and that the population germano-turque reacting with fear and concern.
because for many of germano-turcs the spectre that the the the the we croyait death since long temporarily its appeared: since the attacks tracks of mölln in november 1992 and to solingen in may 1993, it not the the the there has more had of violence comparable with this context extremist of right against the turkish.
that the the the it there has in germany a xenophobia, it not the the the in has yet never been question.
the network extremist of right which has been analyse as however of proportions which the dimension is far of the the the be predictably.
the& the what a return to the the the the ideology bloody the& the, the& the such was the as of the parution on internet the daily turkish the& the haberturk the& the.
the newspaper the& the sabah the& the would in however that the the the the a of authors have been a v-homme of the protection of the constitution, and if the the the concerned the fact that the authorities german could be involved in the bourbier of the the the extrême-droite.
it the the the is of way raisonnée that the the the has reacted the community turkish in germany: it has called this weekend to a commémoration silencieuse to victims of violence raciale before the is of brandebourg.
this not the the the is that two weeks before that the community turkish of berlin and the political germans and turkish had thought to a- the cinquantième anniversary of the the the the agreement of recruitment germano-turc.
it the the the is with of colours gaies that the cohabitation had been implementation in stage, symbolisant a history of success.
the reports of some media turkish are the the the the indeed of the the the a gifle: the& the the gift of the the the the germany for the cinquantième anniversary the& the such is the as of the the the a article in the platform turque- the& the haber x the& the, which. plateau the context of the series of murders.
also the parution german the the& the hürriyet the& the not. which not of the the the in from of conditions univoques.
the& the it thing to puer the& the, such is the as of the chronic of the the the ahmet külahci.
it there would that of people would been murdered, would paid of taxes and would made by their work a contribution important to the reconstruction of the the the the germany.
the the the the action of the police has been seen of way very criticism on the forums germano-turcs and they had by the following debated the success of their research.
why it not the the the is not already come many more early to the the the the spirit of authorities german of do of research in some you undesirable of the the the extreme right, if the the the étonnent the authors.
more of the the the a. shows ready the less to of means rhétoriques even drastiques: the& the if the the the the case still to be slipshod, it not will to migrants nothing of the the the another that the the the the defence and the the the the weaponization the& the.
the& the it will, the better auto-défense the& the.
the& the the peace domestic in germany on very of the quality of the the the the information and of the relevant of the punishment of the the the the together the network the& the, writing the& the selen the& the.
this that this means if the peace domestic in germany is in danger, the attacks of mölln and solingen in the years 90 have, explained.
the photo of ruins after the the the the had of solingen is deeply ancrée in the memory german and turkish.
because no another event not the the the has shown more clearly to turkish living here that the the the it there has a threat tangible, and to germans, on what the mistrust and the remote by of acts of violence can need.
the attacks have however aiguisé the feel the we in the community turkish.
not never repeat the errors the past
once it the the the is especially the the the the failure of the policy german after the attacks which the press turkish if the the the is complaint: helmut kohl has refused of to visit to survivants of mölln.
after the the the the had of solingen it has sent a télégramme of condoléances the head of the the the the state turkish, if the the the is fact represent to funerals to cologne by its minister of affairs foreign klaus kinkel- kinkel ones to the the the the time in its speech, how of taxes pöttering the population turkish local.
as if the value of the the the a human could be évaluée on the amount of its charges tax.
the the the the current report of media turkish shows a time of more how the mistrust of many of germano-turcs is deep towards the the& the state of right local since this when.
furthermore the efforts of the the the a more broader clarification and reassessment the terrorism of the the the extrême-droite in germany, a message clear is this occasion necessary.
the bank to scandal the lake of zürich
the bank the more aventureuse of the the the europe not. is not in italy or in france, but in switzerland.
the the the the ubs has fact almost bankruptcy in the crisis financial and patine meantime of the the the a crisis to the the the the another.
it the the the is a german which must should now.
this not the the the is certainly not this that the the the axel weber if the& the was imaginé.
after its starting spectacular of the head of the bundesbank the we has had knowledge in july, that the the the it pose in 2013 a post almost also spectacular: president the council of the the the administration of the great bank switzerland ubs- a great not to a career bolt and big.
axel weber if the the the is publicly réjoui, has found the the switzerland for its beauty and the the the the ubs for its solidité recently achieved and has fact to of the the the aimables comments on the future colleagues.
the& the the the the the ubs has succeeded the turnaround the& the.
the& the i i welcome of the cooperation with kaspar villiger and oswald grübel the& the.
and yet, as the months of september it was clear that all was change.
a marchand of securities of the the the ubs to london had détourné all the systems of security of the bank and had flambé about 1.7 billion of the the the eur.
the head the council of the the the administration of the the the the ubs oswald grübel, a banker, known not only in switzerland, has had from.
the president the council of the the the administration of the the the the ubs is treated since as suffering- and all demand: when axel weber revient-il finally?
we have already learned that weber can be recommended of the bank to from of february 2012.
and it reprendra the presidency of the the the administration already in may- not not in 2013, as the the the the has release the bank tuesday.
for axel weber this becoming difficult.
it not the the the is not banker, many more professor of the& the economy and president of the bank, and it have certainly had need of the the the a period of the the the themselves.
of the the the a only coup it assume then the responsibility for the strategy of the the the a bank, which has of prove still a time of more that the the the it has since long emphasis the as of the& the the more great bank to scandal of the the the europe the& the.
in indeed, the the the the ubs is of the the the a on huge- until the the the to recently, it was the more carry gestionnaire of the the the active the world, and of the the the the another, it patine since of years of the the the a scandal to the the the the another.
nothing, particularly, not the the the savings the if proud bank switzerland.
this has started for the crisis financial.
until the the the in 2007 the the the the ubs had a reputation i.
the the the the image the gestionnaire switzerland of the the the active, silencieux and solid, but also rusé, it the the the the had combiné with of objectives ambitious: it he also become, in the area of the the the the investment bank, a very great bank.
therefore the the the the ubs gérait of the the the a on in 2007 with 1.6 billion of dollars more of the the the money from of the the the a clientèle easy that any another bank the world.
of the the the another on, it had on in as that bank of the the the investment in the league of more large banks the world.
this has fact impression.
the the the the former banker – geiger and more later professor of bank for of long years to zurich story: the& the i the the the i always taken the the the the ubs as model of good bank before my students. the& the
the& the in the the the the preserving current, we. request: how what that i the the the would could all simply i deceive to this point? the& the
it if the the the is deeply horribly.
in 2007 it is apparent that for the first time something thing not it not postponement to the the the the ubs.
the middle of the the the the year the president peter wuffli if the the the is withdrawn of way surprenante, which was treated so as a high intellectual and that the the the a banker génial.
few months more later we has pressenti for what reasons it was party.
the division of the bank had flambé with of documents sub-prime and has the do a cross on of billion.
for épauler this, the the the the ubs has announced a increase of capital of the the the a amount of 13 billion of francs and has fact a cross on.
for this it has indeed found of investors, but which, little of time before, would froncé the sourcils: a substance of the the the state asian non-transparent from of singapore and a substance of the the the state arab, which was past under silence, the point that the the the the we not the the the has even never learned its name.
this not the& the was yet that the first coup.
in april 2008 this if the the the is worsened.
the bank to announce to new of losses. chiffrant to of billion, the president the council of the the the administration marcel ospel, which was still in 2006 the second council of the the the administration the better paid of switzerland,. retira.
in october 2008 the disaster suivit: the the the the ubs. was, account held of its errors of the the the investment, in the crisis financial before the bankruptcy and dut be sauvée by the the the the state.
the bank national has racheté to the the the the ubs of tens of billion of securities should, the confederation switzerland has given six billion of francs for of obligations convertibles in actions, for which it could become copropriétaire of the bank.
any the switzerland has been secouée- because it has noté to what point this can be dramatic for a small countries, of the the the abriter of if large banks.
finally, the total the record of the the the the ubs 2007 if the& the shouted to more of five time the performance economic of the switzerland( see graphically).
the& the we not the the the have not could save the the the the ubs still a time the& the, said the sufficiently of banks, geiger.
after the first disaster it if the the the in is followed of the second.
already few months before, the the the the ubs had lindh to because of the the the a dispute tax with the the the the america and if the the the is declared ready to publish the data of the clientèle easy, which had fraudé the fisc perhaps with the the the the aid of the bank.
in furthermore, it has accepted a payment of 780 million of dollars- in private of profits injustifiés from of these operations with a fine majorée.
and the the the the ubs has more or less published that the the the it had helped to the fraud fiscal.
in even time it has lost something thing which has always been its capital in competition with the rich clients: the prestige of the discrétion.
after the scandal the secret bank switzerland not the the the has more been the even.
it if the the the in suivit the from the head the council of the the the administration and the president the council of the the the administration.
and of the the the the exodus of the the the the money of clients.
and the bank had lost in few months its credibility in the two sectors of the the the case main: the the the the investment bank to because of have speculation and the management of the the the active to because of the the the the aid to the fraud fiscal.
and, as it there when something little a return the calm, and as we the anticipated, that the the the the ubs if the the the in sortirait, it if the the the in suivit of this unfortunate history of traders of as: a only marchand of as flambe 1.7 billion of the the the eur, before that the bank not if the the the aperçoive that something thing not it not postponement.
and the the the the we publie: with the management of risks in bank of the the the investment this not seems always not work.
the& the with the case adoboli, we has could we that the we of risks to too little changed the& the, said martin janssen, economist and professor of finance to the the the the institute bank of the the the the university of zurich.
also the director financial of the the the a great bank german in is course: the& the the problem of the the the the ubs is that the the the it not the the the has not the we of risks in hand. the& the
however it if the the the was exactly of the the the the idea of careful, with which the bankers swiss had since long taken their office, the of become gardien of the great emergency the world: not of too large risks, but the security for the the the the money- and the world could, if the the the collapse beyond of the republic alpine.
the trésors of banks swiss were become the symbol of the the the a as inébranlable as lindt and sprüngli the are for a chocolate particularly noble.
the central of the the the the ubs to zurich will still of hand with the solid cliché of the bank switzerland private- it not the the the is that the the the a little more great.
already the situation is classic.
the bank has its seat to the station central of zurich, which led directly of the station central the lake of zurich, which himself is by by the summits enneigés of mountains swiss.
the buildings are here prestigieux, the loyers of shops top-priority among the more high of the the the europe.
the bijoutiers as tiffany the the the if, we the is here between the shops of traditions swiss all as those of the confiserie sprüngli.
since of centuries of bankers swiss have résidé here: of the bank national in incidentally by the palace the credit switzerland until the the the to of banks private élitistes as julius bär.
we sometimes in the hall of the the the entry of the the the the ubs by a heavy is.
to the the the the internal, the walls are revêtus of marbre, before. are of the the the épaisses carpets of leather, and to on the logo of the bank, a great label for the& the safe the& the.
the the the the ubs knows this that the customer research here: the security.
this idea of the bank switzerland has a day or the the the the another aside the market- or failed the two large banks swiss, the the the the ubs and the credit switzerland, as the head of the the the a small bank private switzerland is.
it préfèrerait not not read its name in the newspaper, finally as all the bankers swiss it fact of affairs also with the two large banks.
the the the the ubs would become, too great, trouve-t the the the it- especially in the the the the investment bank, where the anglo-saxons. would in furthermore répandus.
the swiss not the the the there would more nothing to say.
the& the and when, even, they. are since long adapted to mœurs of anglo-saxons. the& the
this has been in indeed the bank of the the the investment anglo-saxonne which has changed the the the the ubs, it has fact of profits high and then the occurred: no establishment financial european not the the the has lost as of the the the money in the jungle of sub-prime as the great bank switzerland.
the disaster is become accused the 15 october 2008.
the& the this wednesday the coalition government the small countries to seven million of the the the inhabitants has done the more great operation of rescue in the the the the history of their nation the& the, writing the the the the author lukas hässig in its paper the& the the airliner of the the the the ubs the& the.
with until the the the to 68 billion of francs about, be 45 billion of the the the eur, the men political have accepted of save of the bankruptcy the great bank.
how this pouvait-il happen?
if the the the the we about with of bankers swiss, they see the problem especially to the size of the the the the ubs.
in june 1998 two of three large banks swiss have concluded together a huge group.
a bank has been created, which was already too great for the small switzerland- and has registered without an a increasing.
this which has helped, it the the the is that the two banks prédécesseuses different of the the the the ubs have include: a bank rich, but in léthargie with as point very the management of the the the active to zurich and a more poor, but, already more very internationalisé.
all to coup, the banks of the the the investment international have had taken access to many of the the the money, with which they have could turn a huge mir.
two names are our to the the the the upwardly of ubs: peter wuffli, of 2001 to 2007 head the group ubs, and marcel ospel, once president the council of the the the administration.

but ospel. would fié until the& the to the end to wuffli.
and wuffli have probably committed to the end a mistake decisive: the& the it anticipated that its models were the reality the& the, said geiger.
the& the it the the the is a fall tragic. the& the

even when of the the the other banks cherchaient since long to down.
the& the still in in of the the the the been 2007, then that the market of the the the the real american was in flammes, the the the the ubs has bought that the& the, said geiger, the the the the expert bank.
more the the the the euphorie is great more the fall is brutal.
a manager after the the the the another has had from, when to a term to attempts if the the the is out more difficult that the the the the we anticipated.
of cent home ubs are become éjectables and are until the the the to now bancaux.
that which is the great bank has a task registered impossible.
it must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the models of the the the company originated have disappeared.

the union of aid school continues the city for redundancies
the union which represents of hundreds of the the the aid school with lost their employment the months last plans of the the the proceedings wednesday a trial to the city for redundancies unnecessary and discriminatoires. the the the the impact is disproportionate on the schools stuck of coaches pile.
the take are probably the the the the weapon ultimate the union, council the 37e district, for try of do rescind the redundancies.
six% soixante-douze aid school, coordinators of parents and other employees, by part of less, paid of the city, have lost their employment the 7 october last. the leaders trade have compared these redundancies to a vengeance policy for not not have left the city access to a substance for carefully of health criticisms by the groups of workers, and which have allowed of taylor the the the the gap of budget the spring last.

dennis mr walcott and the department of the the& the education of the city constitueront the part défenderesse. the plaignants will represented by eight travailleuses licenciées, all of colour black or of the the the origin latino-américaines, as the most of aid school which have lost their employment.
elizabeth thomas, spokesman the department legal of the city, has said that the wrocław not the the the has not still could see the reasons the trial and not can therefore not do of comments on the claims.
of the the the after a any of complaints invariably by the new york times, the union miserait on the number of redundancies in the schools of districts the more pile of the city for support its complaint against a treatment unfair, claiming that the schools the more poor perdraient the more of the the the aid in reason of the the the a sous-financement field.
while that the the the we not account no licenciement on staten island, and few each to penalty in the institutions of the the the upper east side or tribeca, 17 aid school have lost their employment in the 23e district of brownsville, and 46 in the disbursed and 9e districts of districts south the bronx.

the& the this resolution is to honour the courage of libyens then that the the the they starting to rebuild their countries the& the has said john kerry.
the& the it the the the is a support bipartisan to their aspirations democratic. the& the
the language is perhaps inoffensif but the debate on the libya not the the the has never been simple until the the the to now.
this been, of legislators of two parties are into in conflict, and that the the the with the house blanche, on the wording of several resolutions for to approve or not the role military of united in the mission of the the the the nato in libya.
in june, kerry and mccain have presented a resolution for to allow the the the the employment limited of forces military american in libya.
the project of law has been quot by a broad for bipartisane and not the the the has never fact the the the the subject of the the the a vote the senate.
but the even day of the the the the failure the project of law, the house of members has also rejected a able for to reduce the funding of operations american in libya.
the mission american is therefore has under a form of purgatoire legislative- the congress enough contrarié for- the management of the mission by obama, but not enough for him as the the the the herbe under the a.
the the the the indécision the congress has been acknowledged by the events.
tripoli is has under the insurgents in august and gaddafi has been killed the 20 october last.
the mission of the the the the nato if the the the is officially over the 31 october.

the new able remportera-t-elle all the support of the commission of affairs foreign the senate or divisera-t-elle the legislators as in june last?
the senator and president of the commission richard d. lugar( independent) if the the the is opposed to the last version.

the in the capitole, the house must vote this week a amendment to the constitution for to a budget balanced, a priority legislative for almost all the dissident the congress, and few democrats.
the able, supported by the republican bob goodlatte( virginia), will the first amendment constitutional on the budget, or any another question, to to a vote of three-month to the house or the senate.

it if the the the is of the the the a about very sensitive for the leaders military, which not want not may not grateful or in disagree with the public that the the the they serve.
they counts also that the angry of troops revenantes of the war the formality has been, worse.

after the return of its two son the fighting with the marine-protected, the colonel pensioner mark cancian the has avertis that the public considérerait their service under two prospects.
some the regarderaient with respect because they have been with to of insurgents and have endemic to of contrées lointaines.

when the the the it recherchait a employment, he said, it stank that few people which him claimed to the inform wondered of way subtile if the the the it would able of take the coup under the stress of the the the a employment demanding to washington immediately after its return the fighting.
the& the when you abordez the about the service, you are has to of impressions negative the& the, remember the colonel cancian when the the the it about to its son.
the difficulties of military surgissent, in part, to from of the the the the indifference american towards the wars.
the victoires are rarely congratulated by a countries also little surroundings with the the the the army and which has little of the the the benefits direct of wars in iraq and in afghanistan.
the& the in as that nation, we not valorisons more the the the the héroïsme of the even way that for the second war world the& the says the lieutenant general pensioner david barno, which has criticisms the troops in afghanistan.
the place of this, the congratulations of men political and the people. concentrent widely on the depth of suffering of the the the a military.
the troops are recognised for the number of periods of services endurées, the number of the the the friends lost or the the the the extended of injuries.

the documents judicial, it by newsweek, détaillent the strategy of the defence, and essentially the fact that the the the the army not can not be on by of soldiers in service or not for of injuries caused in the forces armed.

the things have changed since the years 50.
then that the women not the the the have always not, officially, the right of the the the go the fighting, this distinction not the the the is under that on paper: the lines of front of recent wars are rarely only masculines.
in iraq as in afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play a role of more in more important, particularly for enter in contact with the women local.
result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost the life- two third in situation of fighting.
it is time for the the the the army of. moderniser says susan quot.

the walls have of eyes: the researchers you attending on facebook
before of become the new face of the the the the extreme right in europe, mushrooms behring breivik was a simple gars by on of its views anti-immigration in line.
monday, breivik, which has recognised have been taken of the the the a madness lethal in norway the months of july by 77 victims, has been has to its first trial.
then that breivik has is only, it was far of the the the the be on the cyberespace: it had past a great part the time before the the the the attack on its computer, to discuss with few each of million of nationalists which supports the groups of the the the extreme right on the sites of networks social.
after the tragedy of this been, the researchers want in know more on these people.
but how the find?
easy ... connectez-vous to facebook.
the& the we have achieved that the the the it not the& the was not if difficult that it of the find the& the, says jamie bartlett, author main of the the the a report published recently by the group of reflection of demos on the populism digital in europe.
facebook crammed of as of the the the information personal, states jamie bartlett, that the researchers could simply use the the the the tool publicitaire the website for find the people that the the the they seek with a need scientific- the way which the mercaticiens the are since of years.
the the& the team of jamie bartlett has discovered that the the the a half of member are adore of groups of the the the extreme right in europe. it the has ciblés with of announcements, but the place of the link to a new group or product, the announcements invitaient the users to respond to a investigation. the questions posed concerned their level of the the the education, their which face to the violence and their optimism as to their own future.
in coming in contact with these people thanks to facebook, jamie bartlett and its colleagues have could what 10,000 supporters of 14 parties of the the the extreme right in 11 countries european- without leave the office.
the& the it the the the is a new way of do of the research the& the, says jamie bartlett.
some results not are not the all surprenants: the supporters in line of groups of right are rather of men, young and against the the the the immigration.
but étonnamment, the& the those which associent activisme in line and hors-ligne are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent that those which are behind their but of the the the computer. the& the
the the& the study of demos not the the the is that the the the a example on the way which facebook is become the new tool no between the hands of scientists.
the groups of reflection, the researchers in medicine and the politologues using the website for study all the issues which do the questions of health as the tendencies social, thanks to the& the i the the the like the& the, published on the walls and put to day of statuts.
with more of 800 million of the the the users active which top in average three certain by day, the the& the supernova of data the& the generates a explosion in on of research, by the number of work of research which the name the website this in the as of almost 800% by report to five last years.
for some researchers, the the the the advantage of facebook lies in the fact that the the the it you can of the the the study of people that you not could not approaching in the street.
the& the before, when you tentiez of the the the out of from on the people the party national british, it was very difficult of the identify. the& the
the& the you deviez you to the party, but they not you would never that to enter the& the, says jamie bartlett.
the& the facebook commenting all this- you have directly access to their information. the& the
of the the the other say that the website could offer a way of the the the identify and of with the problems health and social.
according a study recent the d. megan moreno of the the the the university the wisconsin-madison, and of its colleagues, the young students which talking on facebook of their emprise in state of the the the ébriété had great more of chance of the the the be alcooliques that the students discreet to this about.
megan moreno suggest that the colleagues of students, such that the councillors, can monitor the website and intervene for help possibly a student which the status parlerait too often of the the the alcohol.
the& the you not can not with a problem if you not the diagnostiquez not the& the, dimitri georgiou, co-auteur of megan moreno and director the centre for the health, the behaviour and the development of children to the the the the institute of research for the children s to seattle, states the washington post.
the& the we know how identify the children to risks, and which not would in a another case not recognised. the& the
facebook also accède constantly to information of its users.
the the& the team the website which if the the the for of data has studied the statistics on the situation amoureuse and the day of the at valentin, the rate of participation to elections of mi-mandat of 2010 and a equivalent of fortunately national( thanks to information only available- the champions of the freedom digital have for long supported that the website could to available its treasury of data to of the the the other people to of purposes of research).
but the users of facebook know that the website the is, that it their don or not- in exchange of power play the scrabble with a friend which. is to of thousands of kilometres, the website is that to access to your information.
but that. 17-year when the users of facebook are part of the the the a investigation which they not the the the have even not course about?
then that the researchers have of consignes, defined as to the way of recueillir the information other that the the the in incidentally by the the the the internet, it in is any another thing in line.
the& the i not believe not that the the the a great number of the the the users have already thought the fact that the the the a sufficiently can study their profile the& the says voyager selwyn, sociologue the laboratory of knowledge of london, of the the the after a study of 2006 that the the the it has they in supposed the walls facebook of its students.
the& the as that the the the they know, the trade not the the the were vus that by their friends. the& the
then has the question of methodology.
even without to by internet, it not the the the there has no guarantee that the about of the the the a study be completely honest.
on facebook, it is impossible of know the degree of truth of the the the a profile or on the wall of the the the a user.
the& the this that you say on facebook and this that you are in the reality are two things completely different the& the, states voyager selwyn.
it the the the is why, despite its experience in as that sufficiently technological, voyager selwyn think that the the the a bloc-notes and a stylo are the better tools that the the the the we can use.
the& the nothing not will replace the world real and the contact with the people, the& the compete.
the& the the studies social are like issue the the the the aspect social- and the social, this not the the the is not before a computer. the& the
the& the cold and inhumain the& the: first court of the the the mushrooms behring breivik
mushrooms behring breivik, the the the the human with admitted have organised the two attacks which have fact 77 deaths in norway this been, if the the the is describes as a combattant the& the of the resistance the& the at of its first appeared the trial which. place to oslo.
the& the i am a commander military the movement of resistance norwegian and of templiers of norway the& the, explique-t-il before a room of the the the hearing full of 500 people.
the& the in this which concerns the competence the court, i the récuse, because you stick your mandate of the the the organisations westendorp a ideology of hatred and because that the the the it support the multiculturalisme. the& the
the& the i recognise the facts but i not champion not guilty. the& the
the judge torkjel nesheim has interrupted breivik during this monologue because it the& the not he not him to the the the the opportunity of the the the use this trial for express its views. the& the
for the even reason, it has refused of to breivik, which has driven with him a speech on paper, about to parents of victims to the end of the the the the hearing.
the judge nesheim has also asked to the police of keep breivik in detention 12 weeks of more, him has from of about to media for four weeks and the the the the has warning that the authorities surveilleraient of very almost all the visits and correspondances for eight weeks.
a thirties of parents of survivants and of victims were- to the the the the hearing.
some are came in the the the the hope of look breivik in the eyes, of the the the other for be course that the the the it would put behind the bars.
all have part to the the the the hearing in the aim of see the end the trial.
the& the i the the the the i found cold and inhumain the& the has said a survivant of the the the utoya to the chain of television norvégienne nrk.
the& the i not the& the was not to the the the the feel, but i the the the i personally a little on after have seen and course the was. the& the
vêtu of the the the a adjust dark and of the the the a emblem blue, breivik is left calm and professional during all the trial. it has watching the journalists and the survivants in the eyes in coming and up the court.
despite the the the the idea strange according which breivik s to a and movement of the& the resistance the& the, the judge has powers that the the the it not the the the was not maddest. it has also said that the the the it not the the the there has no evidence that the the the it has is with of complices.
the attacks the 22 july seem therefore be the the the the implemented of the the the a extremist rather that of the the the a group over of radical, this which in réconfortera perhaps some.
but this not reduced not the chagrin or the confusion ressentis by any the nation.
the& the i the the the allocation preferred that the the the it like to a monster, but this not the the the is not the case the& the, has said a parent of the the the a victim.

7 lessons of the the the the interview lost of steve jobs, the cinema this week
after the death of steve jobs the 5 october last, some the the the the have compared to harry ford-. distinguant by the you technical and inventeur of the the the the technology modern.
but this that the adore of the the the apple can find of more revelatory in a maintenance of steve jobs found recently and which will television this week in first part of the the the a film on the main markets, is to what point this spirit creative had including the process and flow of work of products.
it was without no doubt a which and a rêveur. it if the the the identifiait to a hippie but was also very méticuleux and organised, and that the the the a améliorateur of the the the organigrammes- a human which croyait that of many leaders of the the the companies souffraient of the the the a the& the disease their by think that the the the a idea géniale fact 90% the work ... the# 91 the but the## the a amount considerable of work manuel between a idea géniale of the the the a product of the the the exception. the& the
in 1995, bob cringely has the series television the& the triumph of; nerds the& the. this series retrace the birth of the the the the computer, and it if the the the assoit for more of the the the a at with steve jobs for a long and less companionably.
has this époque-là, this was about 10 years that steve jobs had had leave apple. it physician already heavy on its new company technology next, for to a adoption popular of the the the the internet.
then that the the the a small part of the the the the maintenance with cringely is used in nerds, it says that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
it the the the is only after the death of steve jobs that the the the a video complete is dignity. in the boot the réalisateur.
this video, slightly remontée, is the basis the film of 68 minutes apos steve jobs:; lost interview, which will solely the cinema wednesday and thursday next.
for someone the the the a of known for détester the inform approfondis, steve jobs seems here étonnamment enthousiaste of the the the detailed of philosophies propellants and its strategies trade.
and unbelievably called.
on four points different during the the the the entrevue, the answers come a long-term at after the questions- between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which steve jobs alleviate clearly its thoughts, in the aim of the the the to a answer should.
we startled also of times where the perfectionnisme of steve jobs ressurgit, where it seems look of the the the hear the questions of cringely, him giving of by of coude for the do up and to to of questions or issues of more great importance.
crew before the the& the era of pixar, of the the the the ipod or of the the the the iphone, we is a aspect étrangement prescient on lost interview. steve jobs evaluates this that the the the it considers of good or of bad home the other companies and fact on of its own vision on the the the the future of the the the the technology.
it the the the is a thing of read the – posthumes of the career of steve jobs, but it there has something thing of gross and of the the the inspirant on the the the the human that we see here, the rêveur anxieux to the on of the councillors.
it has a vision on the way which the things can be and must be.
it the explains then the wary of following in implemented.
this a récapitulatif rapid of seven sequences remarkable of lost interview:
on the way which it has learned to should a company:
the& the during all these years, i the the the i always asked: the the the why you the things? the& the and the answers are constantly the same: the the the oh, simply because that the the the it must the do. the the the the& the
person not knows why, person not réfléchit in depth to things in a company.
it the the the is this that i the the the i discovered.
steve jobs continues in giving of details on its efforts for to simplifying the compatibility home apple.
perplexed as to the way which the costs were in- we débute often by a the& the cost standard the& the evaluated to view of would, then ajusté with a the& the variation the& the- it has developed a factory automatisée which thus the calculating particular of costs commercial.
on the the the the opportunity of play a turn the pope:
steve jobs story the the the the incidental of the the& the box blue the& the that the the the it has created with steve wozniak- a equipment which servait to pirater the networks telephone and téléphoner free in longue-distance.
the the the the equipment has fact the the the the subject of many mari the prerequisite, but the the the the euphorie of steve jobs here in its factual of the box blue as a act of the the the appropriation is contagieuse.
it describes the way which him and wozniak have tested the box in using a telephone public, in incidentally a appeal then in. connectant of the the the a network at the amp the t to a another all in contournant as of satellites that possible.
the& the we enveloppions the boule of different things a dozen of time and you hurliez in the telephone public and it you arrivait a minute more later the telephone public of the the the to on, the& the explains jobs in riant.
the& the we were young and thanks to this box blue, we have learned that we could ourselves create something thing able of control of billion of dollars of the the the infrastructure in the world over. the& the
we not connaissions not great thing all the two, but we have as getting a small thing able of control of large things. this was a lesson incredible, and i not believe not that the the the apple have a day had without this.
steve jobs continues in racontant a wonderful turn that him and wozniak have set the point: it has phoned the heavenly with the box blue the like middle of the night in. by to for harry kissinger and has asked to about the pope.
then that several member of the of catholic are convoqués the middle of the night for about the very american, the two complices been in maddest laugh just before that the pope himself not be woke.
on its love with the technology( and démarchage of optimism hewlett):
has the the& the age of 12 years, to the hunting to coins détachées for invent a fréquencemètre, it looking the number of optimism hewlett in the the the the directory and him is a coup of over.
little after their companionably of 20 minutes, steve jobs also a job of the the the been to time part-time home hewlett-packard.
the& the this has had a influence remarkable on me. it the& the was the only company that i the the the had seen to this âge-là and this has trained my definition of the the the a company and the way which the employees are treaties. the& the
steve jobs is by the following become the the the the a of employees hp to visit the laboratoires of research of the the the the company, located to palo alto, where it has discovered the the& the first computer of office never designed. the& the
it was also carry that the the the a alarms, know a small tube cathodique. i the the the in am has amoureux.
the the the the teenage that i the& the was is reimbursed home hp and has started to write of programmes for this machine.
on the the the the improvisation of the the the the innovation:
has several times in the the the the interview, steve jobs about of the the the getting of new products on a coup of head.
the beginning of its career, then that the the the it if the the the progressing for sell few cards of routes imprimés, a customer him request of the the the assembler a computer full.
work to only 30 days of credit, it dût if the the the after of the the the the assemblage and that of the distributor of devices finis.
more later, home apple, it. remember of difficulties suffered for develop a souris of the the the computer:
the& the i i remember of major amusing ... we i criait on in argument that the the the it i should five years the# 91 the for invent a souris which cost$ 300 the## the. i the the the in i had enough, i am out and am have see a concepteur. the& the
mid-90s days more later, we had a souris that we could invent for$ 15 and which if the the the avérait unbelievably reliable.
on the large companies which if the the the essoufflent:
, before that the the the it not would revivre apple, steve jobs had anticipé the way which of many leaders industrial 153. deceive and lose the control of their on of market.
the& the agree that you travailliez home ibm or xerox, you are a best copieur or a better imprimante, and after? the& the
you have the monopoly the market, therefore the the the the company not meeting not more of success.
the at and the marketing can the do improvements, therefore the# 91 the this are these types of people the## the which from by should the companies and the staff tourism-related in product are set to the the& the gap of taken of decisions.
the you in product which has led to this position of monopoly is completely ethnicity by the people which not can not imagine us a good product by report to a bad product- the work manuel required.
it the the the is this which if the the the is product home xerox ...
xerox have could détenir any the the the the industry technology.
it have could do ten time its size current. xerox have been the microsoft of years 90 ...
they have snatched the defeat to the victory.
on the the the the innovation as form artistic:
the& the a huge part of work manuel between a idea géniale of the the the a product exceptional ... to able that you développez this idea, it exchange and grandit. the& the
you news great on its subtilités.
it there has of compromise to do ... some things that you not can not do, the électrons the can, the glass, the robots, the factories also.
you must keep of thousands of things to the the the the spirit( these ideas) in the assemblant the antagonise to other.
finally, the decisions are taken by feel staff. it if the the the is of the the the try of you detailed to better products that the men have created, and of the the the try of the the the to these things the product that you créez.
with has said a day that the good artists preda and that the large artists volent.
we have always shame of is of the the the congratulated ideas.
it the the the is in part this which makes macintosh exceptional. the people which worked on were of musicians, of mir, of zoologistes, of historians, which. are simply proven the better scientists compact the world.
if this not the the the is for the science technology, they would fact of things extraordinary in a another area.

the& the we be also forced of we about of the the the a some number of our staff civil and, because that the reduction would will if quickly, we should almost certainly send of civilians in leave without wage in view of the the the reach the the the the objective. the& the
the& the these changes ébranleraient the faith of those which supports our military and endommageraient seriously our preparation. the& the
the cuts toucheraient possibly the troops combattantes, still panetta.
the& the, that the funding in time of war of accounts of operations of contingence to the the the the abroad not be not directly schools by the sequestration, the efforts of war would negatively affected by the serious perturbations in the budgets of basis the& the, has warning panetta.
the& the the staff contractor would reduced, overnight of delays in the contracts and the supervision of contract which supports the war the& the.

the& the this not the the the is not a result with which we can live, and this not the the the is certainly not the that we should we impose the& the.
the& the the sequestration is a threat for the interests of security national of united, and it not should not have to. produce the& the.
that the letter of panetta and the warnings recent of senators increase the pressure for a compromise budgetary or a appeal to exempter the pentagon of cuts, still to see.
panetta has been of more in more virulent the about of compressions possible, even if it is has himself the more high post the pentagon cumulant of years of the the the unambiguous the budget the congress and the house blanche and knowing that the the the it was has to of choice difficult.
to a conference of press the week last, the secretary to the defence has starkly a picture dark of this which could can- a military with a coquille, but not of core.

and panetta has said that some of more large projects of defence could to the couperet, there including those already testés and some just to first stages of the planning.
this list incluait the fighter f35 attachment strike, a new bombardier provided, the sous-marin balistique of new generation, the new ship of fighting present-day and the new vehicle of ground, which duty-free the humvee of the the the the army and of the among.
to a term the development and to testing the f35 could generating 80 billion of dollars of the the the economies on 10 years, but its supporters say that it the the the is a step essential of the the the improvement and of answer to threats subject-matter of the china and of the the the other rivals.
how repérer a lies
a scrutiny on the manchettes recent made to what point the it and the lies are hanging in the life daily.
the candidate republican to the presidency herman cain is occupied to exchange of claims of harassment sexual with several women the every on accusant the the the the another of lying.
the administrateurs of penn state have been accused of parjure for have allegedly covered of reports according which a you of football to the retirement has attacked sexually of boys.
the week last the president french nicolas sarkozy has been taken by a microphone open claiming the president american barack obama that the first minister israeli benjamin netanyahu was a menteur.
the lies has destroyed of data-collection and convulsé of countries.
the member the congress of new york and fame of the the the the internet anthony weiner, is past for a idiot in émettant quickly of démentis contredits by of evidence irréfutables.
the the the the former candidate to the presidential john edwards has been accused of violations the funding of campaigns linked to the cover of the the the a liaison extraconjugale.
and then, no of that which has experienced the the the the history not the the the oubliera never the circus media that the president optimism clinton has unleashed in mentant at of its second mandate on ​ ​ its involved sexual with frassoni lewinsky.
the catastrophes of tricherie to tests of the the the the school and of the the the the university are there.
it there has had of case where the teachers have given the answers of tests to pupils order of. do, see on their – of performance.
the spiritual which should teach the contrary sending the message according which lies and the tricherie are&.
how of it rencontrons-nous?
on a day data, the studies this that you can hear of 10 to 200 lies.
in fact, many of they are of lies pieux.
a another study has shown that the foreign. mentent to three times in the 10 first minutes of their meeting.
détecter or repérer of lies is a competence essential that everyone must over, to the time for of reasons personal and occupational.
far of the the the be a game of society similar to, say, of charades, where the the the the objective is of if the the the écrier: the& the i t the the the i had the& the, the detection of the it is a one serious of knowledge gender-based on of data scientists collected the in of six last decades in of prestigieuses universities with they a research in depth of such projects, particularly in psychologie and in physiologie.
a of results of the research is that the myths the more old on the lies have been démystifiés.
the menteurs you them in the eyes.
they not bégayent, rougissent or not if the the the scaremongering not always.
not not in conclude that the menteurs are difficult to détecter and difficult to démasquer.
a détecteur of lies as can find the truth in evident the structure of the statement, the micro-expressions faciales, the training of the question and the time of answer.
i the the the i past several years to examine of results scientists in the and body and always émergent of the knowledge on the it, and it is clear that the detection of the it is a competence modern which is easy to learn and useful for naviguer in our world complex- especially if your responsibilities occupational include particularly the the the the become, the strikes, the negotiations or the management.
the good menteurs are habiles to, read the other, in the by to the the the the feel, in duty-free their own emotions and intuitivement détectant how the other the see.
we know of the the the after of research that the extravertis mentent more that the introvertis, that the men say more lies the& the centrés on them the& the then that the women say more of lies the& the centrés on the other the& the- usually for protect the have of someone the the the a- that the people mariées mentent less often to their partners that the people not mariées( but that the lies that the the the they racontent have trend to be huge).
we know also that if you are perçu as a mécréant, the other will. feel less guilty of you lying.
how you say if someone the the the a ment?
all of the the the first, at the behaviour normal of your about.
it the the the is this that the the the we called the& the establish the data reference the& the.
this aid to provide a point of reference for it the changes ultérieurs.
at the posture of your about, the laugh, the quality voice-controlled.
you must know if someone the the the a remue normally its feet in permanently order of not not to of accusations unjust when you the see and the feet the middle of the meeting.
then recherchez of untrustworthy of conduct misleading verbaux and not verbaux.
reigns these untrustworthy as of flags soft, not of evidence of the it.
the people misleading can overpower the high the body when the the the they trying of. remember of their history, they can look their feet to the is,. instead to a opt-out, change of posture of way significantly or present a soulagement of the& the post-interview the& the- a soupir was of soulagement, a change of posture when all the questions difficult are being.
the interrogateurs they often faussement that the the the the maintenance is ended just for seek to remaining the reaction post-interview.
also, are attention the vocabulary of your about.
the famous dudley peterson has dérapé in using the past all in argument that its woman murdered was vivante, db a research national for the find.
the individuals misleading can also use a language distancé: the& the i not the the the i not had of relations sexual with this woman ... mlle lewinsky the& the or repeat fully a question difficult.
the indicators verbaux the more common are subtils.
someone the the the a can use many of the& the language of wood the& the at of its answer to a question difficult: the& the now, ... for say true ... if i i remember goods ... to my knowledge. the& the
this makes the answer perceptive rather that factuelle and is often a flag red.
it not the the the there has not of formula wave for the detection of lies, but the development of competences for recognise the it is possible.
these competences together the chance of anyone of the the the avoid the victimisation by of arnaqueurs in their life professional and personal.

you not répétez never the répertoire.
to what. must this?
i believe that it the the the is, because that we have nine disques and we can interpret more of 120 songs and everyone like of songs different, it the the the is for this that the the the it is very difficult of choose what songs interpret every single.
when we have two or three songs in the répertoire that we not the the the have more interprétés since very long, this we aid to remain concentrés and we aback because this we remember the reasons for which we aimions these songs and that we can have forgot.
this fact that the destinies be more interesting for we and by therefore i think that the the the it becoming also more interesting for the people.
with this was, you célébrez 20 years of knowledge.
in looking in backwards, is difficult of believe all this that you have succeeded?
yes, absolutely.
in first place, i believe that no of we not if the the the had imaginé that we prerequisites people a great group rock, and the fact that we the the the the have fact for more of 20 years fact that this seems a dream.
we continue to tell our bénédictions and the fact of power continue to do of the music together we émotionne many.
we we like and we keen create of the music.
we are unexpected of the the the go to of places the world by we have always to go.

that means for you the fact of the the the have been a part fundamental in the creation the grunge?
this has been always a honour for we of people part of this group of large groups.
we are very friends with the people of soundgarden, mudhoney and alice in chains.
it the the the is surprising when the the the a movement compel of the the the a group of the the the friends and is little common.
of time in time, a group compel of the the the a city, but it the the the is many more strange when five or ten groups outside in even time of the even city.
we are proud and it the the the is a honour for we of people part the group of seattle.
we hands still with some of the the the between them of time in time.
the the the the year last we have part to a festival with alice in chains and we have been the canada with mudhoney, we have seen to soundgarden in their was, therefore we are unexpected of the the the be still friends with all them and it the the the is a honour for we of people part of this its of seattle which has compel.
it the the the is also very strange that the the the a group as the your. maintienne concepts and with the same member for as of time.
yes, four of the the the between we have been together for 21 years and matt( cameron) we has joined it there has 13 years, and only this is many more of time that many of groups attempt normally.
in first place, i believe that we are all unexpected of the the the be still in life and, in second place, we we preoccupied all for the other.
we are all friends intimes and thanks has this it there has of boulevards musicaux which give of the freedom to everyone of the the the expérimenter.
we have of the confidence the each in the other with the music of everyone and this not could go better.
your relationship with the word fame not the the the has not been easy the however, thanks to your success, you have could do this that you want.
how trouvez-vous a balance?
to able that we have grew, this has been more easy for we of find a balance.
we we assurons the fact that we not let not too of time in was because it the the the is easy of do in this game of large multitudes and of people which like your music.
if the the the the we not the the the forget not that the people are that for the music, this we help to not not forget that the the the it must respect the music and this which the the the the has organisation, without. to in head the fact that the the the the we is famous and a rock star, this which not the the the interested not really to no of the the the between we.
how you forget of your another project, mother love bone?
i think that we have writing of good songs and the beginning this has been grandiose.
we have been a group for almost three years and we not the the the have not published a compact before of the death of the the the andy( andrew woods).
it there has had many of frustrations for the fact that the the the it has lasted if little and the more important is the fact that we are still very friends with bruce( fairweather) and examine( gilmore) which have started in the group with we and when i the the the listen a song or i see a photo i think to the the the the incredible person that the the the andy has been and how it i was laugh, this has been always a pleasure of work, laugh, about of the music, the football and of many other things with him.
it was a be human surprising and it we lack.
the group national palmas robertas strangle the destinies to costa rica.
it is true that you know its work, especially eddie vedder and for this you the the the the have historically for the the the the openness?
yes, the production we has sent of vidéos with of different proposals and evaluating has been the group that we have been the more, therefore we are here of see this that palmas robertas can offer in direct and this must be very distrayant.
for what changez you always the words of yello ledbetter in direct?
this is a question for ed( eddie vedder), therefore i not know not.
it the the the is him which the chante and i believe that the the the it the fact with the first words that the the the it imagine.
as bassiste, what are its influences?
it there in has as ...
among the first which i i remember it there has geezer butler, john entwistle, c. j. ramone, john doe, paul mccartney, chuck dukowski ...
it there has as of the the the influences, that i would about any the the the the afternoon on the bassistes that i the the the love.
how has succeeded pearl jam has keep matter the grunge in spite the fact that it not the the the is more to the fashion?
i believe that we all we devices a little déconnectés the word grunge.
when i the the the in think, this i remember the groups that i from of mention, as mudhoney, soundgarden, nirvana and all those which have compel in even time and, if this is matter now, i believe that this is wonderful, because it the the the is a music which applies the penalty listen and the groups as mudhoney are now the better music that never.
the beginning, its music had a content more obscur and now this is become more positive.
to what. must this change?
it the the the is interesting, because i believe that the the the it there has of songs in the new album which seem more site, but it there has also of songs, as; end however just breathe qualified as songs very obscures, even if these can clock a little positive.
with the two, when ed the has am for me, i the the the i wept when i the i listened and these are of songs deeply obscures.
i think that if you grandis and it there has a traumatisme in your life and you perds to a parent or friend, these things starting to influence tone art and your music and these songs, without doubt, account this for me.
i think also that the the the the we can also be happy and even as it the the the the we can do of the music left.

park or mountain?
the architects coïncident on the the the the opportunity of the convocation beyond of the vote-counting on the him
the competition city on the 16 doors other of new the debate on the role of collserola to barcelona
to the middle of years the the the 80, in full apogée of the déjà-éteinte corporation heathrow of barcelona( cmb), this administration has with of affichettes of promotion of collserola.
the booklet définissait the mountain as the great park of the barcelona heathrow.
of more, it originally also a comparison, in figures, with the central park of new york.
with the death of the cmb, in 1987, the park is become of new, in the the the the imagination of many of people, the limit higher of barcelona, the capital catalane being the only which not if the the the oriente not on the the the the an north-south, otherwise high( mountain)- low( sea).
the lone of collserola as park natural is to the the the the advantage of this idea.
the reference not the the the was more central park otherwise yellowstone, with of sangliers in the role of the the the the polar yogi.
this was the situation until the the the to this that, in september, the city has convoqué a méga-compétition composed by 16 competition for all the doors of the the the access to collserola.
a is may to the the the the idea of park, without no doubt.
it the the the is this, or, someone the the the a wants to of doors the scope.
the question transpires any only: collserola: park or mountain?
the competition, as in this which concerns its organisation as in this which concerns the reflection on the city is a issue of companionably of all the architects of barcelona.
it the the the is almost a issue récurrent which two member of this old caste of the the the elected speak when the the the they. acknowledge in a get.
and this is rightly a of few views on which coïncident three architects of barcelona, teachers academics, which if the the the there are presented.
miguel roldán, daniel modol and marta bayona: the competition is appropriate.
for roldán, after issue the front littorale the& the it is necessary of the& the debate on the& the the front of mountain the& the because the speech of ildefons cerda, that of pâtés of houses green not the the the has not been they to end.
the& the it must from of the basis that the park more maximise of barcelona is the chair.
between other things for its great accessibility.
collserola is more complex the& the, has given the decision the the the the you for which the as of the& the doors of collserola the& the apos a the& the into lexique the& the: it not must think to these the& the as the access to a park, but the délimitation of some areas in which it must act the& the.
modol, as roldán and bayona with of the the the the experience in the world urbanistique, qualifies the proposal as the& the challenge intellectual the& the with the& the few périls the& the.
of périls which. dérivent of the& the the the the the uncertainty of the projection of the the the the space public the& the after the the the the experience upon in the years the the the 80 and which has had in the area the forum the& the its chant of cygne the& the.
the first fear is the own délimitation of borders on which the the the the we can build.
the& the limit something thing means establish already the not with the& the, it the the the other, its dépassement.
the& the it must think to of new instruments urbanistiques, of planning, because the current the# 91 the in reference the plan general métropolitain( pgm) the## the can cause of indicating us the& the.
in. into more to the question, modol opine that, in simplifiant, the tip of the region el valles of collserola the& the can be course as a park, the of barcelona, not the& the.
modol remember that the the the it there already a work fact by the patronat of collserola which the& the not must not be lost the& the, in at for the the the the opportunity that the city offer to its corporation of the the the intervene in this project the& the as the first at the& the.
of more, it heard that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the sauf-conduit that can to architects of the the the enter in the debate, but the& the doubt the& the if this look technical must should the teams multidisciplinaires( the& the any a success the& the, he) that the the the the we has the create: the& the we, the architects, should be only a instrument the& the.
bayona insinue that the answer to the question which gives the as of this coin is complex, because of for the competition it lack a vision overall of collserola: the& the the the the the we has convoqué 16 competition cross-sector- he- in the sense montagne-mer, but it not the the the there has not a reading longitudinale which way and exists the area in its together the& the.
this fact, the less in this case, that the the the it has opted for part in the 16 competition.
of the the the a another way, a project for that the the the a of doors can choquer in the programme and definition with that of the the the the you of the is nearby.
in its opinion, yes, the city should guarantee that the strip immediately higher to the of ronda of dalt should provide, in any its extension, a area of the the the equipment which just a fresh transition between the city and the green.

the secretary dionisio pérez jácome gives elect the details of the the the the accident air in which has lost its life the secretary the government, virgin blake and another seven people
the secretariat of communications and transport( sct) has informed that the results set in obviously on the the the the accident in which has lost its life the secretary of government, virgin blake mora and another seven people, they that the the the the helicopter has choqué directly against the soil in complete integrity structurale, without that the pilot can try a aircraft forced.
for a conference of press, dionisio pérez jácome, secretary of communications and transport, has mentioned that the the the before the speed of the the the the aéronef, the pilot has but that the conditions of climate were adequate for is.
the& the the elements which seem must that the the the the unity has had of various contacts with the soil, the pales have had contact with the trees to 25 metres where the the the the unity has lost the fuselage the& the.
it has informed also the fact that the the the the unity was- for 19 people, therefore this satisfaisait the requirements necessary for transport the staff.
of more, it has said that the investigations are in the area of the the the impacte not duties not the the the the appeared of coins the soil.
the& the in a research the the the the we has reported that the the the it not the the the there has not of coins or components of the the the the aéronef in a another place, the the the the impact if the the the is presented of way structurale.
the& the the the the the helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and satisfaisait the requirements for the transport.
the soil présentait a pante of seven to 30 degrees of the the the inclination.
for the at, the secretary has assurance that the the the a priority is of the the the have the results the more quickly possible the but the the the the investigation can last few months, it can even last a year.
to its turn, gilberto lópez barrowman, director general of the the the airports and services applaud has assurance that the at of the the the the impact, the the the the helicopter of the the the the state major presidential invisible in speed of cruiser and this if the the the is past on a soil- ascendant.
the& the this information support the the the the hypothesis of the the the a functioning normal cruiser the at of the the the the impacte the& the, he.
for the conference of press, the holder of the sct, pérez jácome, has ten-t six elements important in the the the the investigation:
flight visuel:
according the normative aviation, the flight has been achieved according the rules the flight visuel, this which means that the the the the crew must have of the visibility for the flight and the soil.
conditions weather:
the reports in the the the the aicm mentionnaient of conditions adequate the speed, and the as and has able that the the the the aéronef avançait to the area least between df and the the the the state of mexico it there had of layers of nébulosité to low up.
roads sélectionnées:
it is likely that the& the to because of conditions of nébulosité the the the the crew has aim a area of up more low and more of visibility to the valley of cuernavaca.
location of the the the the impacte.
the coordonnées of the the the the impacte and the last registration of the the the the aéronef on the radar coïncident, probably before the the the the impacte it not the the the there has not had or loss the control or altération of the knowledge of flight.
dispersion of leftovers of the the the the aéronef in a area reduced:
the the the the information available until the the the to now can of assumed that the the the the impacte has had place on a knowledge right and latérale.
the model of dispersion of leftovers of the the the the aéronef can of assumed that the the the the helicopter if the the the is her against the soil in of conditions of the the the integrity structurale.
the the the the we not the the the has not analyse of trace of fire or of the the the explosion:
in the the the the place the fulfils it not the the the there has always no trace in the leftovers of the the the the aéronef of the the the a type of the the the explosion or fire.
the the results of the the the the investigation they that the the the the aéronef had had of many contacts with the soil.
for the work of ground the the the the we has found of coins of the the the the aéronef to a up of 9 thousand 200 feet above the level way of the sea, the soil présentait a pente which will since seven dégrées to 30 degrees of the the the inclination.
the photographs this the sequence in which it if the the the is possiblement désarticulé the long-term of its informed.
the the the the information provides of elements which seem must that the the the the helicopter can have had of impactes many with the soil.
after the research meticulous in a area more broader that the the the the place encerclé, around of the the the the accident, the the the the we not the the the has not found of coins disperses of the the the the aéronef, this which longer the assumption of that the the the the impact has had place in of conditions of the the the integrity structurale.
mss announcement protocol for find the sequence of the the the the obesity
insurance social is a investigation for find the sequence of the the the the obesity in the case of children and young the this is supporté by of specialists the ipn
the the the the institute mexican of the the the insurance social( imss) has announced that the the the it is a investigation for find the sequence of the the the the obesity in the case of the the the children and young, called protocol the the the genetic of the the the the obesity of children and young the the the which will of the the the have the marqueurs our the overweight.
in a release, the head of the the the the unity of the the the investigation medical in biochimie of the the the the hospital of specialisms the centre medical national the 20th century, miguel cruz lópez, has explained that the the the the we had trained a team multidisciplinaire of doctors, nurses, nutritionnistes and pronk social.
this team is appuyée by of specialists and of students of third cycle of the the the the institute national of health public( insp) and the centre of the the the investigation and of the the the studies advances( cinvestav) of the the the the institute polytechnique national( ipn).
to the the the the investigation the the the the we would to part the population with or not right, to. present to units sports participating the imss to menendez of méxico, where if the the the their the evidence to minors all the samedis to from of 8: 00 hours.
it has out that the protocol has started in the the the the unity trainers cuauhtémoc( estado of méxico poniente) and that the the the to from the 8 october, the the the the activity. place in the the the the unity trainers of nezahualcóyolt( estado of méxico oriente).
after have reached the the the the objective of an 500 or 600 minors, the the the the study will in the the the the unity trainers independencia( the south of distrito federal) and finally in the the the the unity trainers morelos( the north of distrito federal).
it has explained that the the the the objective of this investigation and that e connaitre the components and the the the the importance of the genetic in this which concerns the development of the the the the obesity and of the the the identify home the children and young mexicans of factors of risk for prevent the the the the appeared of diseases dégénératives chronic.
as the the the the we célébrera the 14 november the day world the deliverable, it has mentioned that the the the the objective is that of an three thousand children and young between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the surveillance of their parents, for the the the the application of questionnaires specific point to the the the the food.
they will also requested on their activity physical and their their of the the the offspring family of their diseases, for avoid the factors of risk which déclenchent of affections as the diabetes or the the the the satisfactorily rénale.
it has fits that the samedis the the the the we migration to all the participants of mesurages anthropométriques( weight, size, circonférence of the size), pressure from, determination of levels of glucose, triglycérides, cholestérol and insuline and genetic( the the the the we looking to identify the people our to the the the the obesity infant).
cruz lópez has out that this investigation is the win of the concern of professionals of the health for the the the the alarming taken of weight in the case of minors.
the the the the from of health of 1999 and 2006 have out that in only six years it there has had a increase, in the case of boys, the 77 for% in obesity and in the case of girls the 47 for% the in this which concerns the overweight the the the the we has observed also a increase dramatic the the the, souligna the expert the imss.
it has as that the justification for the research of marqueurs is based in the fact that the population the countries is different of other by its history genetic.
it has informed that the the the in average, the mexicans have a 65 for% of the the the offspring indo-américaine, a 30 for% european and a five for% african and this condition. for in the people our the deliverable and overweight.
it has explained that the the the in general, the genetic of the the the the obesity. put in the the the the inability of bruler the the the the excessive of the the the energy that the the the the we consume( calorie), which. dépose under the form of disease.
the sufficiently has explained that the benefit direct for the participants it the the the is the the the the assessment intégrale of children, this which can of détecter if the the the they are a degree of overweight or of the the the obesity.
ila even said that the presence of plis of colour dark( acanthosis) on the suffocating and the the the the avant-bras they the over of a of taken métaboliques and even pré-diabètes.
the the the the information is part of the the the a way confidentielle, the doctors the they by writing to parents, by the the the the we explains each of measures and changes in the lifestyle of life that the the the they must to for prevent the diseases.
cruz lópez has explained that the the the it there has three components main which nosocomial overweight, obesity and of the the the other affections chronic: the sédentarisme, which is the lack of the the the activity physical daily, remain the most of the day sitting before the télé and use of means of transport the place of the the the go to a on of distances waterways.
a another because is the high 20-30 calorique, it the the the other the more great consumption of drinks sucrées, hydrates of carbon( tamales- pâté of meat to the animal-based of maize enveloppé in of maps of maize-, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of graisses and protein and the genetic analysée in this protocol.
the the the the asphalte of the the the the unam values the cassis
rafael herrera, sufficiently of the ability of chimie of the the the the unam, growing of asphaltes modified with of polymères for produce a mixture with a best at, regardless of conditions environmental and of temperature
if the signales that the zajedno were resolved, it not would more necessary of prevention about 200 thousand cassis every season of on in the area heathrow of menendez of méxico, avertit rafael herrera nájera, sufficiently of the ability of chimie( fq) of the unam, which has assurance that if the process of construction and maintenance the zajedno bitumineux is;, the cassis could be reduced or even éliminés completely.
for its conference a opinion technological on the cassis, organised in the framework of the the the the year international of the chimie, it has announced that the laboratory which it is responsible growing of asphaltes modified with of polymères for produce a mixture with of characteristics similar to those of the the the the asphalte, but with a resistance mechanical more great, as to of highest as of low temperatures.
herrera nájera has estimated that this type of the the the asphaltes modified could be used in of places in which the climate is extremely somewhere, as some cities the north the countries, for improve the at, and by therefore, the training of cassis.
it has explained that the the the the asphalte, the on more heavy the oil, is a together of applicant of hydrocarbons, of applicant with a weight moléculaire more it, making asphaltènes, and of applicant with a weight moléculaire low, making malthènes, which together give the zajedno its characteristic behaviour viscoélastique.
the behaviour viscoélastique of the the the the asphalte is in the fact that the the the to of temperatures highest, of almost of 180 degrees,. has as a liquid, to 120 degrees it its viscosité is very great and to 50 degrees it it there a state almost solid, for that the the the to of temperatures very low, the the the the asphalte becoming cassant, ajouta-t-il.
this means that in the streets the resistance of the the the the asphalte not the the the is not uniform and. image for the day in office of conditions environmental and of temperature, avertit the expert in sophisticated chemical.
the sufficiently of the fq has observed that the streets of ciudad of méxico in their majority were one-size-fits-all by a zajedno flexibly, up of six layers of materials, which the three last involve the the the the asphalte.
between the layers more superficielles. is the layer of the the the asphalte, educated by of small stones baignées in asphalte and compactées later.
each of small stones which form the layer, signalât-il, is baignée year asphalte.
when the vehicles there happening in old-style of efforts, it can that the forces. are very, in the zajedno.
if the the the the we had of the the the the asphalte amended, these. propageraient better, opinât the the the the ingénier chemical.
on the layer of the the the asphalte, he, the the the the we the a last layer called layer of roulement, made in there with, it the the the other, the grit which is also baigné in asphalte.
as this is the layer in contact with the way of vehicles, it must have more of force mechanical that the layer of the the the asphalte and provide of the the the the adhérence in the street.
being the part the zajedno which receiving and collects the efforts, the layer of roulement requires also that this has a thick adequate and the material which it is made must be treated.
the climate, specifically the the the the moisture and the variations of temperature, are also a factor very important to consider, specifically the the the the water, he, because they affecting considerably the at of the layer of the the the asphalte.
when the soil. mouille, the the the the water. about to the the the the internal of the layer is it the the the is difficult that this ensure, this which ramollie all the layers the zajedno and by therefore because of cassis.
in the trial of training of the the the a cassis, he, the first which. gâche is the pellicule of roulement and only later is affectée the layer of the the the asphalte, but the happens not the the the has not place immediately, but it the the the is a process which must be treated to first signals with of programmes of the the the maintenance adequate.
the member the system national of researchers has explained that the burden of vehicles is a another factor important for the training of cassis and by therefore the the the the thick of every layer the zajedno must be always with to the burden of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, for avoid the training insisted of cassis.
rafael herrera has warning that the the the it there has still many to became and work on the the the the asphalte, by example, the émulsions bitumineuses, which in of the the the other countries exist already on the market and make of prevention the cassis easily and without duty use of highest temperatures.
that the the the has over to the candidate of menendez for be the new miss colombia?
analysis of factors which have fact that melina ramírez serna not the the the show not the krona of miss colombia.
menendez receiving its as number 14 of princess.
of new menendez del cauca is left with the desire of win the krona of miss colombia.
this occasion melina ramírez serna has had. simply with the fact of. find on the podium of gagnantes, be the krona of the the the money and the strip which the the the the accrédite as new princess of colombia.
with the result did yesterday evening to cartagena, where miss atlántico is far-right with the krona and the sceptre, the department amount already 14 securities of princess and melina if the the the a to a there of women of menendez del cauca which. are cooperating almost of the krona but have been he princesses, between which miriam ospina benoit( 1947), clara domínguez borrero( treaty), patricia bellini ayala( 1979), lorena álvarez( 1981), efficient mary alzate( 1983), olga maría arenas( 1987), leila blanque( 1988), mónica evers( 1989), maría consuela pinedo( 1990), from isabel romero( 1993), giselle garcés aljure( 2000), catalina giraldo( 2007), stephanie garcés aljure( 2008).
today the the the today the great question that many of world. ask is:
that the the the what that the the the it has over? because that the result represents the defeat of the the the a great favourite that in every presentation has demonstrated that the the the it the the the the had all for be the new miss colombia, because it not the the the had not been advocating in was queen of the police and best face jolie of vogue, of securities it by the reines taliana vargas or natalia navarro which if the the the have prevailed the krona of miss colombia.
the first factor treated key in the decision taken by the juré of the appointing first princess is the fact that the the the it not the the the has not convinced with its answer to the question the& the? what has been the paper which t the the the has marked and why? raised by martín murillo gómez, of the carreta literaria leamos.
is the answer of the candidate of menendez to this question:
the& the i usually many, i believe enough in the literature, i believe that it the the the is a form of. culturaliser, to i believe that the paper which has marked my early is the& the the small prince the& the, it the the the is a paper enough sense.
to now i usually the& the crime and châtiment the& the, it the the the is a paper of literature universal that we should read all the and now i usually the paper of the the the irene nemirovski, a russian, a paper very like which if the the the called the& the the the the the ardeur of the blood the& the the& the.
this answer not the the the has not mep all of the the the first to because the term the& the. culturaliser the& the and secondly for not not explain what of what way every paper mentioned the the the the had and.
but to the end of the- melina has said that the the the it. stank discounts and happy with the result the& the the the the the universe and wise, it. is this which must. to.
and for all the world, lisez if the the the it you please a little, the& the the small prince the& the is a great paper the& the
between the hypothèses voyager it there has the according which menendez has been destroyed by the favoritisme.
a journalist of bogotá has insinué that being the nabucco, the ovationnée and the candidate which lebedev all the price today( challenge of gastronomie oster, the vote the public for the best adjust håndværker, and queen mother), the& the this has woke the jalousie of other incumbents, has stressé the queen and it the the the is for this that the the the it not the the the has not brillé on the stage the& the.
and the the the the we has noté this in its first presentation in maillot of bathroom to the chair of hilton and its two défilés of the on the couronnement.
even if to two défilés it had leaked sure of the the the it even, the the the the we has noté that the the the it not the the the had not the force and the the the the energy of représentantes of magdalena and atlántico.
ariel osorio, journalist the programme the& the como in casa the& the( as to the house), the military-backed rcn has said that the fact that melina when been was princess the& the confirms the fact that the candidate which also the most of price for the competition not receiving not the krona of queen the& the.
of more, menendez has voicing the press to the end, and this has been a mistake.
a another hypothesis it the the the is that menendez not the the the has not succeeded to convince the out on its interest for the initiatives social, which is in fact the the the the essence the competition national of beauty.
it the the the is for this that two days before the the the the election the jurée international lucy doughty has said that the the the they cherchaient a woman commitment in this which concerns the nécessités social of its countries.
the& the only the beauty not the the the is not sufficiently home a miss colombia, it must look beyond the physical and if the the the axer on its sensitivity social, that the the the before of start the competition are already involved in of projects the& the, expliqua-t-elle.
the the the the we spécule also that menendez has- by its defects of its behind and the fibrose which if the the the observait in its abdomen, but this is contradictoire, because precisely the out the the the the has elected as the candidate the the the beauty natural the the the with the body more healthy, good food and work physical responsible.
the préparateur of reines who hernán orozco reconnait that melina not the the the had not the best body, that the the the it in there had best, the& the but its problem of fibrose on the the the the abdomen, which in reality for me not the the the had not been too notoire, him has left of points the last day the& the.
meantime the journalist guido hoyos, of the them cromos considers that the the the the mistake of the candidate of menendez have been the interventions chirurgicales that the the the it had suffered.
the& the the chirurgies are good, but menendez not the the the has not as the do.
its body not the the the has never been its asset and it has lost to because of this aspect the& the.
for this price, that the competition national of beauty may for the first time, after the policewomen in maillot of bathroom has compel a does hath which if the the the is achieved yesterday evening, the the the the we said that this was a small gift that raymundo was to melina for not not him give the feel of the krona.
reality or not, the truth is that melina thing today the the the today a year of is, not not as sovereign, otherwise as princess, a position which him gives the possibility of represent colombia in a of competition international by has the competition national.
however, it what in the the the the history as a of reines which in spite of its éblouissant an by cartagena, not the the the has not did the krona.
and has been the work of the person of cali which has worthy the cadavre of the the the alfonso cano
a dactyloscopiste of cali is past to the the the the history as the the the the human which has confirmed the death of the the the the& the alfonso cano the the the.
the work of these officials is crucial.
the past 4 november a dactyloscopiste the cti of cali has past to the the the the history as the person which has confirmed the the the the identity the head supreme of farc: the& the alfonso cano the& the, in confrontant its can fingerprints.
of seven dactyloscopistes which work in the offices local the cti, this week it the the the was the turn of the& the available the the the of eliazar gonzález, a human of puerto tejada which working since 21 years in the area of the the the investigation judiciary.
the beginning of its career, gonzález has worked in the municipes of chocó, where many of time it has had to more of five days in the forests for happen to the the the the place in which. were the digging that had be identifiés.
the the the the year 2000 it if the the the is fact transferred to the capital of menendez and after have following of in adequate, it if the the the is tourism-related in dactyloscopie, which is the the the the study of the skin of friction, it the the the other the paumes and the feet.
for the week of the the the the operation against alias alfonso cano we had warning to eliazar of take with him of habits the less for three days.
something thing of very great the the the the awaited.
friday the night it is party for cauca in a helicopter of palmira.
it knew that the the the it to identify two digging and that the the the the we suspectait that the the the a of the the the them was that of the the the the human which pursuit the guérrilla more old the world, by therefore we him has asked of if the the the prevail the card with the ten can fingerprints of guillermo león sáenz( its true name).
but when the the the it is has with the the the the team of the the the investigation to the the the the place the cadavre, it not the the the the has not recognised by its aspect physical, because it was very different of that that the the the it had seen in the média.
it not the the the had not of barbe, it was habillé as a paysan of the area, without glasses and many more maigre.
but the can not mentent not.
accompanied by a loupe galtonienne, of the the the the encre, a préleveur and a statistically, eliazar has compared the can fingerprints the cadavre with those of the card.
its naked not the the the the has horribly not: it if the the the was of the the the the& the alfonso cano the& the.
this even night, the the the the human from of puerto tejada has been the responsible which has confirmed the minister of defence, juan blown pinzón that yes, it if the the the was the head supreme of farc.
to the research of the the the the an
for a dactyloscopiste of sijín of cali the recognition that the president juan manuel santos has fact to eliazar gonzález, in a conference of press for the the the the operation against the& the cano the& the, is very significant.
many of people of translated not our work.
the dactyloscopie is a science will, without for of the the the mistake, which can be cruciale in the resolution of crimes.
to on of the the the identify the digging, the dactyloscopistes based the investigations for the crimes as the flight and the the the the – and confirm the the the the identity of people capturées.
when are capturées, many of thieves are of cards of the the the identity incorrect or not the the the have not of documents.
we let their can fingerprints and the seek in the basis of data.
the sufficiently has conté that in a case of flight it has had unbelievable a part of wall of the the the a house, because in this place the thief had supported its hand for do out a coffre-fort full of bijoux and of the the the the money.
the& the the walls are difficult because they not are not of pistes adequate for in from a an digitale, but in this case we have could to the the the the an of any the hand and identify the délinquant which had part to of different flights the& the,. souvient-il.
the can can also root or confirm of undesirable in of case of the the the –.
recently the the the the we has found a human death, with of bouteilles of drink around of him.
by intermède of the the the the investigation the the the the we has powers that the the the a parent can be was the crime and in indeed a an on the horses coïncidait.
even if this no guarantees not that the the the it be the the the the whodunnit, this the place on the stage the crime.
a dactyloscopiste the cti has explained that the the the the we from the& the the can fingerprints of objects with of réactifs chemicals or physical the& the.
when the the the they so, the the the the we use a préleveur or a strip for the prélever.
postérieurement, the can are envoyées to asif, the basis of data of déclinquents, or the register civil national.
the& the the problem is that the the the it there has still many of colombiens without papers the& the, indiqua the the the the expert the cti.
it has explained that all not the the the is not how the the the the we shows in the programme of television csi.
as all this which shines not the the the is not of the the the however, all that the the the the we affects not becoming not forcement a an.
it can however be used, if the the the the we yields the confrontation necessary.
the the& the indignés the& the challenging the authorities to new york
of hundreds of demonstrators. bousculaient before the place zuccotti for there camper.
a great part of people have it to the the the the order of the the the evacuation and if the the the is which to a park neighbouring.
the intégrants the movement for street street have défié this tuesday the authorities of new york in trying of the the the enter of new, thanks to a order judiciary, to the place of legend, of the the the where they have been which to the the the the is and when the the the they have tried of the the the after a another park of the great potato.
of hundreds of demonstrators. bousculaient before the place zuccotti, where they did access thanks to a order judiciary which can to the the the indignés the the the of camper of new in this place, for that the the the the another on the movement has answered to the the the the evacuation in at a park more the north of the mentioned, where it there has had of new ecj.
the& the our idea is that if the court not we can not to camper of new in the place, we will we up in a another place and we continue the fight legal for to to zuccotti, and to through of sit-ins and of demonstrations peaceful the& the, dit-un of porte-paroles the movement the& the for street street the& the, mark bray.
bray has fits that the answer of the the the indignés the the the to the the the the evacuation of their camp dicté personally by the mayor of new york, michael bloomberg, is has until the the the to courts, where the judge lucy billings has issued a order which owning the the the the evacuation forced of the the the the place and permettait to demonstrators of remain in the camp.
of more, the the the the indignés the the the have occupied a new park s to the confluence of central military-backed street and the sixth avenue, very closest of the the the the entry the tunnel holland, which thread new york and new jersey, property of the paroisse trinity church.
the less for a at they have succeeded to after the the the the place, but after the police if the the the there is which and has arrested few demonstrators, even if bray not the the the has not could confirm the figure concrete, in hats efe the fact that the the the it has seen few journalists by we had also past of menottes.
the the the the organisation assure that the the the it there has of centenaires of people which if the the the were bit in this place, where a delegation of leaders religious if the the the is content in sign of support to member the movement and has tried of the the the intervene in favour of the the the them before the police.
meantime, the place zuccotti- which is a chamber of property private- still closed in meantime the lübeck of the the the a hearing judiciary will by this tuesday for which the the the the we must analysing the legality of the the the the evacuation of this morning.
few demonstrators displaced as that worn and distribuaient to this he of copies of this order judiciary and they the livraient even to agents which surveillaient the place, this which has caused the the the some small clashes the the the, has as bray, which has continually the fact that some official have he the demonstrators.
the the the the order judiciary from to authorities of the the the apos the member of for street street or of the the the apply of the the the laws published after the opened of the the the the occupation or of the the the ban to demonstrators of the the the access of new the park with of shanty or of the the the other property that the the the they utilisaient before the the the.

the cdu proposes of the the the having the president european the suffrage universal
the first day the congress of the the the the union chrétienne-démocrate( cdu), monday 14 november, to leipzig, if the the the is awkward without real difficulty for angela merkel, chancelière but also president the party chrétien-démocrate.
the the the the future of the the the the europe not the the the was not initially provided the programme but if the the the is imposed to the the the the autumn, particularly for with the activists which groups the policy the government too laxiste towards of greek today the the the today and perhaps of italian tomorrow.
the point on the presidency of the commission european, proposed by the direction, has been adopted to the quasi-unanimité.
on 1001 delegated, only nine have voted against and ten. are abstained.
the standing ovation of several minutes to which have had right, to the the the the out of their interventions, angela merkel then, few hours more later, wolfgang schäuble, the very europhile minister of finance, not nonsense not place the doubt.
the the the the idée-maîtresse of the chancelière- and of the point- but in a slogan: the answer to the crisis the& the not the the the is not less of the the the europe but more of the the the europe the& the.
not only because that the the the the europe, it the the the is the peace but because that the& the nine million of the the the jobs on directly of the the the the euro the& the.
for the chancelière, the& the the time is come of the the the a breakthrough in europe the& the.
this could. them by of amendments the treaty of lisbon will of strengthen the control of the the the the union european on the political budgetary of countries of the area euro, but this could also need on the the the the election the president of the commission european the suffrage universal the& the order of give a face to the the the the europe the& the.
such is in all case the the the the a of proposals of the point adopted by the congress which the the the the inspirateur is clearly wolfgang schäuble.
,, it is little likely that the twenty-seven if the the the agree quickly on this revolution: the britain there is takeover and the leaders of the cdu believe know that nicolas sarkozy the the the the is also.
but the milestone is asked.
of even, the delegated have rejected to a s majority the proposal of- the weight of every countries the board of the bank central european in office the weight of every economy, this which course evenings to strengthen the weight of the the the the germany.
soucieuse of the the the it the climate to the the the the internal of its party, the chancelière has multiplié the references to konrad adenauer and to helmut kohl but it not the the the has not not more aim to win its congress on the backs of the& the small the& the countries european or of countries in difficulty quick to- the the the the they germany.
if the point on the the the the europe chooses a paragraph to the the the the importance of the& the the the the the friendship franco-allemande the& the, angela merkel not the the the has not mentioned the france.
except in empty.
in stating that the the the it there has two centuries, leipzig had been the heart of the the the a bloody battle.
of fact, this was the the the the a of more humiliantes défaites of the the the the army napoléonienne.
that represents the fraud to ecj disease?
after the several, the the the the been and the government member the the the the offensive on the ecj disease.
nicolas sarkozy will tuesday 15 november to my for visit a see of the the the several family, and express a speech on the issue- récurrent since 2007- of the fight against the fraud social and the the the the assistanat.
and for they this offensive, which on of the the the a will of do of economies in a context of rigour, but not the the the is not less annonciatrice of the the the a an of the campaign presidential to right, the majority wants. concentrate on the ecj disease.
of the the the first in a aim of the the the economies budgetary: the government considering of the the the impose to employees the private a fourth day of unachieved before the taken in burden of the the the a it of work.
in clear, without agreement of the the the company specific, a worker which- ill they four days of wage, therefore the less 15% of its income monthly.
a able which risk of to of the angry, but which would of statistically 280 million of the the the eur, according the echos.
and which would degree of the the the a another able, of scope more symbolic: impose to officials a day of unachieved not indemnisée in case of the the the it of work( they not the the the have until the the the here not of by of unachieved, against three days in the private).
then that these questions are in debate, the majority recovery also the thématique of fraud, at this time the abuse linked to ecj of work.
the& the the controls will be many more important and, in more, if you are taken, you rembourserez the& the, has warning xavier bertrand the our of rtl, sunday 13 november.
as for of the the the other case, the effects of the the the announcement seem something little disproportionnés with the reality of fraud to ecj of work.
this fact in indeed the the the the subject since 2002 of the the the a followed apos and of the the the attacks political, which have the more often of their fruit.
the french not more ill that the the the, in europe.
attardons we of the the the first on the figures national.
according the see national of the the the insurance disease( cnam), more of 237 million of the the the eur of the the the compensation allowances have been délivrés in 2006.
according the the the the institute of research and of documentation in economy of the health, the compensation allowances accounted in 2008 5% of expenditure of health, with 11,3 billion of the the the eur.
on this amount, 46% concerned the maternity leave and accidents the work, and 54% concerned the ecj disease, be 6,2 billion of the the the eur.
and therefore 2.5% of expenditure of health.
in 2010, the french have known in average pence days of the the the it of work, against 17,8 in 2009, according a study the group alma consulting.
a average which behind of there some: a another investigation, published in 2007 by the website of management of career monster.com, sets that 75% of 40 000 employees french were said not the the the have taken no day of the the the it disease.
a another study, this time of the the the the insurance disease, should that the the the in 2010, 37% of ecj disease were of the the the a period which to 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to a months, 15% of a to three months and 11% beyond.
when we the compare with their neighbours european, the employees french not are not more was that the the the, to ecj of work.
a long study carried in 2010 by two researchers the cnrs sets that the the the between 1994 and 2001, the rate of the the the lack overall( for reasons of health or not) oscillait, in france, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% the denmark, 15% the kingdom or 16% and 18% to netherlands.
the fraud to ecj disease represents very little face the work the black.
as to the fraud, it not the the the reached that the the the a low that.
the strengthening of the legislation since 2002 fact that the controls are systematic on the ecj disease of more of 45 days.
in 2008, on 1.5 million of controls, the cnam has but that 13% of 285 000 being for of ecj of short period were the& the injustifiés or too long the& the, be 37 050 case.
in the case of ecj of more of 45 days, systematically controlled, we ones 11% of case the& the who or injustifiés the& the on 1.2 million, be 132 000.
the total, therefore 169 000 case the& the injustifiés the& the, on several million of employees with had a it disease.
a figure which represents, little face, by example, to that the work the black.
according the member been dominique tian, author of the the the a report on the question in june, it would 9 to 15 billion of the the the eur of lack to win tax by year, be more that the cost total of compensation allowances, and therefore revolting more that the fraud to these last.

policy energy:
the facts must the the the the prevail on the reheated
if the the the it is a about that the the the the we not can with to from of tactics of short term or under the coup of the the& the émotion, it the the the is, the policy energy.
the available and the cost of the the& the electricity influential directly on the power of the the the purchase and on the competitiveness of companies.
it is healthy that the the the a about electoral be the the the the opportunity of think to of such extent and to the place that the the the there but the nuclear.
the debate not will successful that if the the the it explore the the the the together of consequences economic, social and environmental of options proposed.
the french must quot their opinion on of facts objectives, of data rationnelles.
then that we are 7 billion of the& the beings human on the planet, the the& the development population will a doublement of the request of the& the electricity of the the the here to 2050, to less of must a huge part of the population world of the the the a part vital.
in the even time, it will pallier the raréfaction of resources fossil for continue to produce of the the& the electricity in permanently, without forget the the the the impérieuse need of reduce the emissions of gas to indeed of greenhouse for combat against the dérèglement climate, a about disappeared the debate ecological.
the the the the accident of fukushima not image no of these parameters.
it the the the is why the the the the germany still isolée in its decision of up the nuclear.
this not the the the is the case or of the belgium, which surrendering the entitled to the need of power find a source of replacement able of. substitute, or of the switzerland, which heard just not more build that of central of last generation.
has the the the the opposite, the britain, the finland, the poland, the republic czech, the netherlands, the sweden, the the the the africa the south, the china, the the the the india, the brazil, for not from that the the the them, continues their projects with determination.
the united, them, have decided after fukushima of the the the add a unity to their park in display the construction of the the the a central interrupting after the the the the accident of three mile island.
if the model german, axé on the energy renewable, is sometimes presented as a example, the reality contrarie the speech.
the choice of berlin will. them by the renchérissement the price of the the& the electricity, a on energy face by the use heightened the gas imported, in particular of russia, a step of emissions of co2 resulted by the construction of central the gas and the coal.
in few months, the the the the together of these unfortunate effects. are already feel.
the case the denmark is to méditer.
champion of the the the europe of the the& the éolien, which it has 30% of its electricity, it is also the the the the a of more carry users of coal and of gas the fact of the the the the intermittence the were the in under of what, its emissions of co2 and the price of its electricity are dimensions 65% and 50% more high that the average european.
has the the the the opposite, thanks to the moderation of our policy energy, our neighbours acquittent a bill of the& the electricity higher of 40% to the of boasts french.
then that in a economy mondialisée the cost of the the& the energy is a factor key of competitiveness and a shortcut the maintenance of the the the the tool industrial on the territory national, the companies french have of the the& the electricity the less dear of the the the europe.
of this fact, any reduction significantly of the on the nuclear nigh a strong increase the price of the the& the electricity, which uk illusoires the are statements on the réindustrialisation of our countries and the defence the power of the the the purchase.
a price that the the the a broad majority of french. refuse to pay, of the the the as that the the the they not stabilizing not of the the the opposition of principle to this energy, the polls the this.
remember that the policy energy of our countries has allowed of build a gardeners industrial of 125 000 jobs direct and 410 000 jobs trinity.
very exportatrice, it leads a voyager of smes specialised on the markets international and the makes very créatrices of the the the jobs not délocalisables.
if the france from to decide of out the nuclear, this would sacrificed good number of these smes in cutting as skin of chagrin the 6 billion of the the the eur annual of the the the exports french of the& the equipment and services nuclear.
what électricien commanderait a epr designed for work sixty years then that the decline of its manufacturer would programmé?
for solve the the& the equation energy, it must admit that the the the it not the the the there not of source of production of the& the electricity work, not more that the the the it not the the the in there of ply.
the development by areva of solutions little émettrices of co2, nuclear and renewable, which of the ecological of sources of the& the energy.
for the nuclear, keep the more high level of safety is a shall absolute.
we have in france a authority of safety which take a control intransigeant and transparent on the central existing as on the also of flamanville.
our teams, which the amateurish is recognised, are habitées of the even obsession of safety.
in a at, the the the the industry nuclear has known three accidents serious.
a only, three mile island, is heard in of conditions of the the the exploitation normal the it is left without result human or environmental.
has chernobyl, the design the reactor and of reproduce human impardonnables have caused the drama.
has fukushima, some seem forget that the the the the accident result of two disasters natural of the the the a that without precedent which have caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
the the the the industry nuclear details the from of this accident, as it the the the the had fact for the two previous.
win of this approach and of the the the a cooperation between the authorities of safety, the returns and the makers french and germans, the the the the epr there a design the when able of resist to of such phenomena.
then that the the the it is treated by all the électriciens willing of build a central, the the the the it of its construction to flamanville would a wonderful gift offered to competitors of the the the areva and edf in their by the way free for if the the the take the leadership in the the the the no development the nuclear.
it is essential and legitimate of to the best cap energy for our countries, but it would irresponsible of to the the& the émotion, the reheated and the manœuvres partisanes sophisticated a debate also key for the situation economic, social and financial of our countries.
the the the the immigration is a burden or a chance for the the the the economy?
the policy in on of the the the immigration carried under nicolas sarkozy has been criticised under various angles -engorgement of services police, judicial and administration to to the policy the figure, compatibilité of this policy with the status really of the& the countries of rights of the the the the human the& the of the france.
more recently, it the the the is the harassment administrative which are the the the the subject the students foreign which has fact the the the the up, the minister of the the the the internal( read release the 23 may) proclamant the an that the france the& the not the the the has not need of talents foreign, of maçons and of serveurs of restaurant the& the.
but it not the the the is that rarely analysée under the the the the from economic.
it the the the is that the the the it there has on this about a enough broad consensus between left and right.
has right, the tone has been given by jacques chirac which possible in 1976 that the& the 900000 unemployed not should not be a problem in a countries comprising almost of 2 million of workers immigrants the& the, and to left, by michel rocard explain that the france the& the not can not welcome any the misery the world the& the in 1990.
the only difference, the degree of generosity
in 2005, the fear of the the the the invasion the territory national by of hordes of plombiers polish was enlarging to left as to right.
for the two bords, the immigrants are perçus as a burden for the the the the economy and the society french.
the only difference but the degree of generosity that the the the the we daignera granted towards of immigrants.
in its programme, on rejecting. cantonne to of banalités, apos that the codéveloppement will of solve our the& the problem migratory the& the.
this idea of the the the the immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps payante électoralement the but it is economically very it.
as the vividly the economists dudley goldin and geoffrey cameron in a recent book synthétisant the knowledge the more recent on the the the the immigration( exceptional picked: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, may 2011, princeton summer associated, 352 pp.), it there a broad consensus among the specialists on the the the the impact positive of flow migratoires on the growth economic, the wages and the the the the employment in the countries which are of immigrants.
product the the the the immigration anémie the growth and night to the the the the employment.
the fears towards of the the the the impact of migrants are gender-based on the the the the idea that they risk of. substitute to workers national, all particularly the little qualified, policy a pressure to the we on their wages.
but the the the the experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are many more contravention that replacements to employees national, policy for the the the the essential of his in of sectors in shortage of the the the employment.
the immigrants little qualified work in of sectors which not the the the attirent not the employees national, and the more qualified in of sectors dynamic in which the training not following not the the the the offer of the the the jobs.
a indeed positive on the wages
of the even way that the the the a chirurgien will the it to work in a countries which knows a shortage of the the the anesthésistes, these complémentarités between national and migrants are that the doing of the the the immigrants have a indeed positive on the wages and the the the the employment of national.
giovanni peri has and on-call that the the the a increase of 1% of flow migratoires leads a increase pity between 0.6 and from% of wages real to long-term term.
and this without take in account the fact that the diversity organisation by the immigrants an to the creation of the the the ideas and to the growth economic( strong proportion of the the the immigrants naturalisés among the price nobel americans the google, intel, paypal, ebay and yahoo have been gender-based by of immigrants).
the migrants are also fit poured of systems social, in average to up of 1% the budget total in the countries european.
the the the the organisation world the work estimated by example that, in germany, a immigrant drew to the the the the age of 30 years will a contribution will( revenue less expenditure) of 150000 eur to budgets public in average on the the the the together of its life.
nicolas sarkozy wanted, in beginning of mandate, go seek the points of growth manquants the& the with the cows the& the.
the cows in question, in umbrella to discourage the immigrants, have had the the the the right indeed opposite.
the the the the europe has invented the democracy, still to think the democracy european
the democracy is a, valuable the it the the the is also a, fragile.
the continent european should power if the the the in remember him which, for the the the the have inventée to athens it there has more of two thousand years, has known the long-term the 20th century the tragedies of the great war, of totalitarismes, the the the the holocaust, the štefan, but also franco in spain, as the portugal, the colonels in greece.
some have could believe that the the the it approximating, for that the democracy triomphât to of its enemies, of the the the exert the vote, and of the the the the exert of the way the more direct which be.
we knows, since napoléon the& the the small the& the, that the the the it if the the the was that of the the the a have of thought.
the suffrage universal, for be the condition necessary of the democracy, not the the the in is not the condition sufficiently and can even. do the& the instrument of the the the oppression the& the as said once the philosophe republican etienne vacherot.
not, the democracy requires, more: a space public, a spirit public, of values, a organisation, a separation and a control of powers, a education, of lumières, of solidarités economic and social, a justice.
the crisis of the the the the europe that we live is a crisis economic, but it is all as and of the the the first a crisis the policy and of the democracy.

a america weakened by the crisis can manage a world complex with of ideas simple, even simplistes?
to listen the candidate proceeding dissident, the electorate could the believe.
since few days, mitt romney, herman cain, rick perry and the other has the statements tonitruantes and the shortcuts in on of policy foreign, traditionally a point very republican.
on the china, on the the the the iran, on the the the the aid to israel, the slogans- often not étayés- fusent.

the north stream, new is of the the the ntrée the gas russian in europe
the pipeline north stream, connecting directly the the the the europe western to the russia in incidentally the substance of the sea baltic, is entered in service.
it must provide the gas for the the the the equivalent of 30 million of homes.
gazprom, the mega-player corridor russian, has to have the the the the event with underpin.
more of 500 from which four heads of the the the state and of government have part, tuesday last, on the bords of the baltic, between orchestra and buffet end, to the the the the opening the north stream, this new pipeline which links directly, under the sea, the russia to the the the the germany.
symboliquement, the chancelière german angela merkel, the president russian dmitri medvedev, the first minister french on fillon and its counterpart of netherlands mark rutte have turned together the vatanen of the valve commander the the the the entry the gas russian in the network ouest-européen.
with this new pipeline, 27,5 billion of metres cubes of gas russian additional will happen every year in europe western by a first tube of 1 224 km connecting the region of petersburg the no-man of mecklembourg-poméranie.
a second tube must be ended end 2012, will of délivrer the total 55 billion of metres cubes of gas, be the the the the equivalent of any the consumption french.
and the the the the we mentions already the possibility of the the the in build a third on the even drafted.
for gazprom, the the the the for in time and in at of this huge also has of confusing of victory.
the project had been very contested by the poland and the countries watch.
the north stream will in indeed afford of provision the gas directly in germany, in resisted all an earthly by a countries third( poland or ukraine).
the coup, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becoming more difficult, for them, of us on the russia in threatening of him close the the the the access to markets ouest-européens.
the more very the debate, warsaw not the the the had not hésité to compare the north stream to a the& the new pact germano-soviétique the& the, in reference to the the the the alliance between hitler and stalin for after the poland, in 1939.
it the the the is say if the about is political sensitive.
the the the the europe of the the the the west, in definitions its support to this project russian, there has won a more great security of its approvisionnements.
but it the the the is the price of the the the a weakening of the the the the europe of the the the the energy, since the project has created a brèche between european of the the the the is and of the the the the west.
the russia has as, in five years to penalty, do quot its vision of the the the a alliance direct between the russia and the rich countries western, very consumers of gas, and which the gisements are in decline.
the& the this pipeline is a composante of our partnership with the russia, it is a new artère which we considering of way organic the& the, has confirmed on fillon in inaugurant this pipeline, démontrant to what point the large contracts gaziers are also political that the the the economic.
all this explains the broad sourires affichés by the leaders of gazprom,- in number to lubmin, the point of the the the arrival the gas.
the construction of this pipeline is also a exploit technical.
the tube sous-marin is in steel gainé of concrete order of the protect against the ancres of vessels.
it based on the substance of the sea, to 200 i in average.
for the build, it has took avoid of fields of silver were of the second war world.
the& the a are has had be enlevée or destroyed, by precautionary the& the, made jens müller, spokesman of the society north stream.
it has took also gasthuis the measures for protect the fauna and the fauna.
the tube is a long-term serpent of accumulates, it as 242 towers eiffel, that nothing not the the the interrompt on any its length: or valve, or station of maintenance.
a platform of control was will the broad of the sweden, but the responsible the project there have up then that the swedish were little willing of see a society of the the the state russian if the the the establish of way permanent the broad of their coasts.
the& the in case of the the the avarie, we stop the an the gas in less of the the the a minute the& the, should jens müller.
in case of killed, the gas content in the pipeline if the the the opinion. therefore in the the the the air.
but this case is was little likely by the makers which have provided the soudures for know a killed all the 100 000 years.
the surveillance of the the the the state the pipeline is be by a robot sous-marin, traîné by a ship, for the the the the observation external, and that by a equipment which can to the the the the internal the pipeline.
of the form of the the the a quot, it is introduced to the the the the internal the tube, broad of the the the a from of diameter, and it is prompted by the gas.
to the the the the arrival, after three days not of travel to the speed of 3 metres second, it paper of information precise on the has déformations the accumulates.
the pipeline has been designed for work 50 years without have to just the any but.
the movement the gas is simply be by the pressure.
it is of 200 bars the starting, and of 100 to the the the the arrival.
five societies have concepts their forces for to this project.
the leader still gazprom, which warned 51% of share.
if the the the there are jointes the german e.on and basf( 15,5% everyone), and that the dutch gasunie and the group french gdf suez( 9% everyone).
these five societies have created a company common, appointed north stream, known of build and pay the pipeline.
it has its seat to zoug, in switzerland, where the the the the tax is particularly favour.
gazprom has then loué to this society, for 20 years renewable, the all of capabilities of transport of gas.
the& the gazprom pay for the capacity total, what that be the amount of gas really transportée the& the, should jens müller.
the funding of the construction the pipeline has been assurance to 30% by the shareholders and to 70% by of prepared bank.
the cost total of work should reach the 7,4 billion of the the the eur for the two tubes.
for gdf suez, by example, the the the the investment if the the the is monté to 240 million.
but the shareholders minoritaires are make of returned in their costs, since only gazprom assume the risk.
the pipeline émerge of the baltic to lubmin, on a present-day sablonneux coffin of pins.
of valves, highest of 4.5 metres, make the is of opt-out the gas.
of sensors mesurent the pressure, the temperature and the taken the gas which sometimes, before that the the the it not be transferred in the gas germans.
since tuesday last, this terminal receiving a million of metres cubes of gas russian to every at which is.
