a strategy républicaine for counter the re-election of the the the obama
the leaders dissident justifièrent their policy by the need of combat against the fraud electoral.
however, the centre brennan considers this last as a myth, claiming that the fraud electoral is more less to united that the number of people killed by the lightning.
of the the the,, the lawyers dissident not the the the have recensé that 300 case of fraud electoral to united in ten years.
a thing is some: these new provisions influenceront negatively the rate of participation.
in this sense, these measures mineront in part the system democratic american.
contrary the canada, the states americans are responsible of the the the the organisation of elections know to united.
it the the the is in this spirit that the the the a majority of governments americans promulguèrent to from of 2009 of new laws when more difficult the process of the the the fees or of vote.
this phenomenon has taken of the the the the that after the elections of november 2010 which virent if the the the add 675 new representatives dissident in 26 states.
in result, 180 projects of laws ability the the the the president-in-office the right of vote in 41 states were introduced during the only year of 2011.
the new laws election demand that the electorate are a card of the the the identity with photo and a evidence of citizenship american.
by,, these laws gaps also the periods of vote by watertight, prevents the right of if the the the these as voter the day the; and my to citizens with a dossier judiciary their right of vote.
before the elections of 2006, no state american not the the the effort of electorate of present a card of the the the identity with photo.
the the the the indiana was the first state to ask a such requirement.
the court supreme of united confirma in 2008 the which of the law of the the the the indiana.
the authorities républicaines if the the the empressèrent of the the the expand this practice to of the the the other states.
the in of two last years, they parrainaient of projects of law in 34 states for force the electorate to present a card of the the the identity with photo.
it is important of note that, contrary the quebec, the citizens americans not have not of card of the the the identity universal as the card of the the the the insurance disease.
of fact, 11% of citizens americans, be 21 million of people in age of vote, not have not of cards of the the the identity with photo from by a agency government of their state.
by,, five million of new electorate in 2012 not have not of the the the a such coin of the the the identity.
however, it in costs often more of% dollars for to the card of the the the identity required.
the new restrictions affecting of way disproportionately the young, the minorities, and the people to low income.
in indeed, 25% of about, 15% of people all less of 35 000 dollars the 18% of citizens of more of 65 years and 20% of electorate of 18 to 29 years not have not the card of the the the identity required with photo.
, more.
the students, of electorate considered as voting more for the candidate democrats, not are not allowed in several states to use their card of the the the identity with photo findings by their institution.
by against, these same states allow the member of clubs of fishing or of hunting which vote more the on republican of the the the use for vote the cards from by these clubs.
before 2004, no state not the the the effort of evidence of citizenship for vote.
the the the the arizona was the first to present a such requirement.
since 2011, a dozen of the the the states have adopted of laws demanding of electorate of prove that the the the they are citizens americans.
these measures are clearly to limit the vote hispanique.
however, it stronger that two electorate hispaniques on three diverging the party democratic.
by,, the legislators dissident have parrainé in 2011 of laws abolishing the the the the fees of electorate the day the; in eight states.
of more, they have limited the right of people and of groups of provide a assistance to electorate désirant if the the the these.
these restrictions not are not without result.
by example, at of the the the the election general of 2004, the campaigns of the the the fees of electorate have contributed to been about 10 million of citizens.
however, the measures adopted since 2009 have fact down of 17% the rate of the the the fees of new electorate in 2010 by report to 2006.
of more, the legislators dissident have adopted of laws in five other states for to reduce the period of vote by watertight.
by example, at of the the the the election general of 2008 in florida, 33% of electorate which have voted by watertight were about, then that these the not accounted that 13% of electorate of the the the the state.
it in was of even with the hispaniques.
they not accounted that 11% of electorate, but 24% of citizens which by by watertight.
in return, the white which up 76% of electorate not accounted that 46% of electorate voting by watertight.
, course the legislators democrats and their supporteurs. are opposed vigorously to the the the the adoption of laws ability the the the the fees of electorate.
several projects of law have been blocked by the vetos of governors democrats.
the the the the lawyer general of united is heard for suspend the laws the more controversial.
they have could limit in part the damage.
by example, only 16 on 34 states have adopted of laws ingredient the presentation of the the the a card of the the the identity with photo.
however, the new rules put in place will incontestable to more difficult the the the the president-in-office the right of vote in 2012.
the criticism democrats unjust the nature up of laws which have been voted and they there see a objective obvious of the the the influence the results in 2012 in of states key.
a report the centre brennan of 2011 apos that the states which have adopted these laws account 171 of 270 votes necessary the college electoral for winning the presidency.
it is too early for say with sure that these amendments legislative the level the system electoral will of immense significant on the result of elections presidential of 2012.
but a thing is some: these new provisions influenceront negatively the rate of participation.
in this sense, these measures mineront in part the system democratic american.
screening the cancer of the prostate: to the test or not?
in indeed, the test of the the the psa rather sometimes of results most, with of not results negative or still of not positive, which cause of interventions medical unnecessary.
of what do hesitate still more the men already resisted to to of tests of screening.
to the test or not?
we have asked the the the the opinion of two specialists.
in the studies conducted to united, it there had many of contamination between the groups witness, it is therefore difficult of the the the interpret these data and of the the the have of recommendations farms.
a another study, evaluating european, has concluded to a difference of mortality between the patients which have had a screening and those which not the the the in have not had.
this study has also demonstrated, with a followed after 12 years, that the the the we has between 30 and 40% of more of chance of the the the have of metastases if we not the the the is not dépisté.
i recommend therefore the test to from of 50 years, or to from of 40 years if we has a parent direct which has already had a cancer of the prostate.
the men of the the the origin afro-américaine are also more to risk.
the key is of take the good decision a time that the the the we has analyse a cancer.
it there has of cancer susceptible and of the the the other which are indolents.
it must really do understand the patient the degree of risk of its cancer, in him respecting the options possible, in not with not necessarily the cancer of the prostate which not been not an to the life to long-term term, and in adopting rather, in these cases, for a surveillance active of the disease.
today the the the today, many of the the the men home which we detected a cancer not will not treaties, because their cancer not the the the is not aggressive and not threat not their life.
we will their suggest of do of the surveillance active and if the disease making, we will their offer a treatment.
of more in more, we all with need of criteria for decide which should or not should not be treaty.
i recommend therefore when even of to the test.
but the the the the important is of the the the have a debate with its doctor for determine if we should the to or not.
in cooperation with the society international of the the the urologie, movember has created a tool which can of the the the assess the for and the against the test of the the the psa.

it not the the the there unfortunately not of bullet work for prevent the cancer.
despite the progress of the research, the the the the adoption of good habits of life still the best way of reduce the risks of the the the in a.
we estimated that if all the world mangeait, and seemed enough, we could prevent 30% of cancer.
the& the if more person not smokes, this rate grimperait to the less 50% the& the, would andré buildings, spokesman of the society canadienne the cancer.
by against, we evaluates that the the the about 10% of cancer are caused by the the the the offspring.
several remain also completely are.
for the society canadienne the cancer, the fight against the smoking still a priority, despite the reduction the number of smokers.
the cigarette is with to 85% of case of cancer the lung.
it is also a factor of risk for several other.
this night great to the health of people.
the& the still today the the the today, it there has 1.5 million of smokers the quebec the& the, regret the spokesman andré buildings.
data encouraging: 10 years after the the the the from of the cigarette, the risk of die of the the the a cancer fall of half.

in too great amount, it fact increases the risks of the the the be reached of the the the a cancer by.

the boson of higgs décortiqué
the the the the announcement of the discovery likely the boson of higgs has created all a sensation, the the the the been last, and for because.
we believes in indeed that this boson contribution the mechanism responsible of the mass of any thing in the the the the universe, nothing that it.
and then, it if the the the is of the last mosaic which the the the the existence is predicted by the model standard- our better, or the& the less worse the& the explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the on- but which not the the the has not still been seen empiriquement.
but for the physiciens, it not the the the is not still completely course that the the the it if the the the be, the higgs.
we knows without the the the the shadow of the the the a doubt that the the the the we but a union new mosaic, and that the the the it like many the boson of higgs warned by the model standard.
in furthermore, of new data unveiled this week at of the the the a great congress of physical, to kyoto, seem the confirm, but it lack still of data for in be perfectly some.
assume all of even that the the the it if the the the be, the higgs, since the chance of. deceive seem slim, and see of what it if the the the is.
it there has, in this low world, a law hand no debunks that two things not can not. find the even place in even time.
not way of the the the notice this rule- and not the the the try not too very, you will you do it.
however even if the physical of particulates is a world, strange, it if the the the will that the the the it has, it also, a law of this kind: the principle of the the the exclusion of pauli, which stipulates that two particulates not can not after the even space the even at if they are in the even the& the state quantique the& the- this the& the state the& the passes roughly roughly in some of their characteristics.
of that, the physiciens divided the particulates in two categories.
in a has, we is of good citizens named fermions, which anybody calmly the principle of pauli.
and in the the the the another if the the the scaremongering the bosons, a which strip of the the the anarchists which not the the the have of respect for nothing- in all case, not for this principle, this which means that the the the they can form and,. find the even place, in even time.
these bosons. – then in two groups, according the website( absolutely extraordinary, of the the the,); particle adventure, of laboratoires berkeley: the mésons, that we not the the the conjunction not here, and the the& the particulates of force the& the, by which the large forces of the nature. are and we the boson of higgs would in something ensure 49.
these bosons-là, it must the would here, not are not all of bestioles also unmanageable that the the the we could the believe.
in fact, if you persuade to read this chronic, it the the the is thanks to a boson of the the the a extraordinary banalité: the photon, or the the& the mosaic of light the& the which is the the& the messager the& the of the force électromagnétique.
when, in indeed, a mosaic with a burden electricity accelerating or exchange of direction, this the& the apple the& the the scope électromagnétique in this place particular, a little as a caillou launched in a dig.
of this the& the dérangement the& the born a shockwave électromagnétique( of the light, or of the the the the infrarouge, or of the the the the ultraviolet, etc.), and this shockwave not the the the is nothing of the the the another that the the the a photon- and therefore, a of bosons the& the carriers of force the& the.
scope more stable
it in will of even with the boson of higgs, to this difference almost that it the the the is a another scope, the scope of higgs, which must be the& the annoy the& the for that this boson arise.
however, this scope of higgs is many, many more stable that the scope électromagnétique the for the the the the exciter, it must reach of very, very highest energy, a little as if the the the it if the the the was of the the the a dig frozen which only a very biggest postponed could rider the surface.
it the the the is why it must a huge scandalous of particulates as that the megascience- the broad hadron collider is a vaccination of 27 km of circonférence!- for reach of such energy.
the the the the analogy with the scope électromagnétique is of new useful for explain the report between the higgs and the mass.
this not are in indeed not all the particulates, or all the materials, which it with the scope électromagnétique.
some, as the magnets, the are, but of the the the other not- a end of paper, by example, not will never of himself on a it.
and of the even way, this not are not all the particulates which it with the scope of higgs: those which the are have a mass, then that the other( as the photon, like) not the the the in have not.
now, that the the the what that the& the can to the& the all these research, request mrs plamondon?
for the science, this is to check the validity the model standard( ms), and this can also to physiciens of hard all gap between the comments and the prediction the ms.
they are of the the the, several to much enthusiastic that the the the we in is, because the any difference could open a is on a the& the new physical the& the and butcher some holes the model.
it, it must the say, has still of the the the huge deficiencies, not proposing no explanation for the gravity( oups!) or the on dark, which form about 80% of the on of the the the the universe( re-oups!).
but we not the the the has not found of such there the megascience until the the the to now.
consequences
the consequences of these research in the daily of mr and madam tout-le-monde, they, are more difficult to predict, but we have wrong of assume that the the the it not the the the there in will not.
stick: the all beginning of years 60, the pioneers the laser, in the laboratoires bell, not publishers not the revolution that their work 153 remaining.
they in entrevoyaient of applications scientists, but nothing the still.
in fact, we has already said fire the take willard boyle- which has worked in the bell labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which has himself set the point the first laser permanent( the first were pulsés), in judgements-, the starting the laser was rather seen as a the& the gimmick of labo the& the.
imagine ...
and then, the applications can also raising of any the the the the instrument which surrounds the research.
by example, this even willard boyle has set the point a small raluca-ioana of light in 1969, the in of its work in preserving.
this raluca-ioana,, that this not the the the was not the all its intend original, is now of the the the the& the dry the& the to all the devices photo digital the world, and him has effort the nobel of physical 2009.

it the the the is very little when we knows that the the the we up all by die a day.

the& the since six months, it there has always of three to five beds which are occupied by of cancer age of less of 45 years the& the, if the the the concerned the dre christiane martel.
53% of patients which are admitted to the house victor-gadbois arrive of their home, 47% from of the the the the hospital.
problem of the the the access to care palliative
we said that 77% of cad not the the the have all simply not access to of care palliative, it the the the other to of care were for it the suffering when the the the a ill is has to the phase by of its life, that this be to home, to the the the the hospital or in house of care.
and several bodies, as the house victor-gadbois and the society of care palliative to home the great montreal,. spécialisent more or less exclusively in the care more to cancer.
it the the the is precisely this great unachieved in the care of health québécois which fact fear to several doctors specialist in care palliative the the the the adoption of the the the a law encadrant the the the the euthanasia and the suicide attended.
since the months of the the the october, a it, signed of sommités of care palliative which the dr balfour mount and the dr bernard lapointe, can for apos of their opposition to a such initiative.
according the dre christiane martel, the system of health québécois not the the the is not enough highly for ensure that everyone will right to of care palliative of quality before that the the the the we accept of deal to the the the the euthanasia.
recently, t, i the the the i seen a overstepping to 14 days to the the the the emergency, in large pain, without that the the the we would the necessary for the relief.
i fear that of patients not demand to die that because that the the the they not are not the care adequate.
and time, several oncologues if the the the endeavouring on their patients until the the the the last day, despite the worst favourable.
the expectations of survival of the the the theirs richard were already minimal when the the the it has abandoned a accurately trying.
when i the the the i announced to my oncologue that i the the the arrêtais the treatment, it i the the the has answered that the the the it mao that i the the the stop of i fight, has told.
yet, it i the the the had said that i the& the was mines!
not of care impregnable
the dre martel believes that 90% of ill which demand to die believers the carers of not not have it to their request after that the the the they have been relieved of their pain by a team of care palliative.
but it must, say that the care palliative not are not absolutely impregnable in the treatment of the pain.
according elsie monereau, guideline of care palliative to the society of care palliative to home the great montreal, the patients would réfractaires to treatments against the pain in 8% of case.
to the any end of the life, the doctors have then often use to the sédation palliative, which falls to go the patient until the the the the at of its death, be of way being, be of way permanent.
we not can more do pretend of not not hear this part of the suffering.
of more in more, the ill not less will have the possibility of the the the have this sédation palliative.
the ill which not are not relieved say always the even sentence: the& the i want die. the& the
but this not wants not necessarily say the& the i want that you i the the the euthanasiiez the& the, this wants say the& the i want be less the& the.
the being of this longer has been made possible thanks to a stock of journalism of institutes of research in health the canada.

with bitcoin, pay and sell without the banks
all the contrary of trade bases current, for on of banks central, of transactions procurement and of costs of treatment between the parties stakeholders.
in furthermore, as often in these technologies, a vision policy is palpable: the conviction that the system monetary current, fact of monopolies bank, led to crises financial.
in fact, bitcoin, invented by satoshi nakamoto( a transaction), is to the time a currency virtual( but convertible in dollars, eur ...) and a protocol of the the the exchange becomes to the way of bittorrent, which can the the the the exchange of files of hand to hand.
about 200 000 transactions have already been in thanks to 15 000 computers on the network.
a small thousand of sites to accept the bitcoins as donations or as way of payment.
the in the bitcoin, after have reached a summit of 30 dollars( 23 eur) in june 2011, has fallen to 2 dollars, five months more later, before of return today the the the today around of the the the a ten of dollars( the in are labour on the website bitcoincharts.com).
nothing of very impressive, compared to trade global in currency real or in products financial.
yet, the bank central european( ecb) if the the the there is interested in a report on the news virtual published in october.
it describes bitcoin as the& the the currency virtual with the more of success the& the, the& the in competition with the dollar or the the the the euro the& the and the& the similar to of news conventional the& the.
bitcoin. differ of the the the other types of currency virtual as the the& the appropriations the& the, used for forward in a game video that the the the the we is in playing or that the the the the we can buy( and sometimes exchange in return).
the network social facebook has also developed this kind of system.
but, every time, a authority central control and trafficking the trade.
with bitcoin, all the noeuds the network are to the time dépositaires the paper of accounts, verifiers, organizations of currency, and buyers and sellers.
how works this network?
every transaction between two users. fact in reality between two redwatch electronic to the way of the the the a e-mail.
except that the the the a user can choose a address different for every payment, hats and the the the the anonymity.
a together of the the the information linked to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of surrender to double key.
the network can and check the the the the authenticity of the transaction.
thanks the content the are, it is also possible of if the the the ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist, in the paper of accounts public, television in all the network.
the the the the étape-clé is to write this new transaction in this paper.
it is by the resolution of the the the a challenge maths launched to computers, and which the all, ensure of banker central provisional, will the privilege of the the the add this line further.
it if the the the is of the the the a phase of hachage of are, it the the the other of into of the the the a carry are in a an digital more short and single.
the computers the& the are the& the the new transaction and him top a number before of the& the hacher the& the the the the the together.
the aim being of find the number which gives a an particular( many of zeros the beginning).
a time this number found, the other noeuds vérifient into that it the the the is the good.
the transaction. is then indestructiblement with to the chain of the the the the together of other transactions the any amendment change the the the the an.
if, for you, a user he pay two time with the even money very quickly( less of ten minutes), a only of two transactions would upheld by the network- the the the the another backlog orpheline because the two have of can different.
the the the the computer with resolved the challenge must 50 bitcoins.
for avoid the the the the inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end 2012.
the number of bitcoins in movement is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until the the the the% millionième, this which leaves of the for ...
the difficulty the challenge is also identified to every increase of the power of calculating.
the life the network has already had of their and of low.
of sites to providing of services for bitcoin have been attacked and the bitcoins in deposits stolen.
the& the the ringing used not concerns not the protocol himself the& the, assure there noizat, which has of to paymium, a company of payment in real currency using the network bitcoin.
the ecb fact state also of opportunities of laundering of the the the money thanks to this service company.
but the cash has also this not.
of actors of weight as one refuse the donations of this nature.
of the the the other, as the platform of blogs wordpress, the accept.
recently, adi shamir and dorit ron, of the the the the institute weizmann in israel, have has the paper of accounts and shown that almost of 80% of bitcoins not they not.
in november, of the& the balances giants the& the have been with.
the& the 30 thousand dollars have been exchanged the& the,. eplp jon holmquist, which working for coinabul, which converts of bitcoins in however.
there noizat, also author of the the the a paper educational on this currency, believes many the potential of this technology in as that network of transactions.
its system, paytunia, is equivalent to a card of credit( in real currency) or to a payment by mobile without contact, but it use bitcoin for validate the transactions, which home and less expensive.
the convey combats of more its identity and can therefore be company.
the system is easy to to in implement home the traders, which not the the the have not need of the the the up of new terminals or software.
it their enough of communicate a address that the the the a telephone can the& the secretly and recognise the& the, should there noizat, which assure have of thousands of the the the users.
it there has a movement general of into in because of systems hierarchical for of systems more horizontal.
the& the it will the time for that bitcoin if the the the we, but 2013 could be a turning the& the, prédit-il.
the ecb, in its report, plans of the the the, of will the risks various, today the the the today considered as high, in case of success of this currency.

a constitution the force in egypt
it the the the is a new coup of poker the president professions morsi.
then that the the the the egypt still more divided that never around of the statement constitutional, which him over time the full powers, it has decided of play its by.
taking all the world of short, it has announced, wednesday, that the the the the house constituent approves its text final the day.
it there has all just a week, the head of the the the the state had devoted two months additional to this house for end its work.
is soon two years that the the the the egypt if the the the depends on a text provisional, several time amended this which weakens the stability institutional and led to of vicissitudes legal.
this new initiative not the the the has fact that the the the increase the from in the countries.
for its opponents, the president persévère in its the& the outrageous repressive the& the, sovereign of the& the trahir its floor the& the and of the& the trample the right the& the.
the on of its supporters, we assure that it the the the is a way of the the the in end the more quickly with the crisis institutional and policy, in speeding the process of transition.
a referendum should be organised in the 15 days.
a space of time very short which- the brotherhood to up to their project of the the the explain the text, article by article, to egyptiens.
for the president, it the the the is also a way of find a legitimacy popular and democratic then that the exclusively fact there in all the countries.
professions morsi seems convinced that the egyptiens will taken, as it the the the the has said in a interview to the the the the weekly american admits.
of the the the as that this use to a vote overhasty but of the the the the ultimatum the people egyptian: the& the be you vote for my text, be i warned the full powers the& the, they before supposément take end after the the the the adoption of the constitution.
it the the the is in a atmosphere strange that 85 member of this house constituent, to great majority an, have voted the text yesterday.
the most of liberals all to the the the the appeal.
mi-novembre, little before the statement constitutional, they had been the is, unjustified not not have could do her their views.
the representatives of rights of the the the the human, of minorities religious or of the society civil in had fact of even.
order that the quorum necessary be reached, 11 people, of member remplaçants, have been added to the unorganised, yesterday morning.
some are very close of brotherhood muslim.
without surprise, it the the the is the more often to the the the the unanimity that the articles have been voted.
of commentators. are of the the the, traditional the fact that the the the a of only differences of the day. be expressed around of ... the the the the at of the swill, some member the committee unjustified that the clock of the constituent was it been.
the text, which was still in is of the& the be voted yesterday evening, has 234 articles.
objects of all the attention, the the the the article 2 still finally same to that of the constitution of 1971, organised that the& the the principles of the sharia are the source main the right. the& the
the parties salafistes, for which the the& the establishment of law islamic is a! major, had power replace the& the the principles the& the by the& the the rules the& the, this which have allowed a application more stricter.
for the islamic, the fact that this article not the the the has not been amended is a shortcut of their good will and of their respect of other within of the society egyptian.
the& the hypocrisy the& the, say the liberals, which not the the the there see that the the the a coup of communication.
because according them, the the the the islamicisation of the constitution. fact to through of the the the other articles.
they are particularly the the the the article 220, which as to the the the the university al-azhar a role advisory, in particular for this which is of check the compliance of laws with the sharia.
according the expert of the the the the egypt sophie pommier, it the the the is worrying because the& the the people be has. express not are not elected and not the the the have no legitimacy democratic.
we can there see the beginnings of the the the a secular the& the.
the fears of liberals are in furthermore attisées by the fact that the next ranked of this university should be, less portrayed that the the the the current.
the& the for the the the the at, it not the the the there has not of the the the involved religious concrete.
with this constitution, we still in the framework of the the the the state civil.
the most of experts which have worked on this text not are not of oulémas but of academics, for some trained in the system french the& the tempère alexis blouet, which preparing a thesis on the transition constitutional egyptian.
but it recognises the& the that the the the it can there have a ambiguity around of the the the the article 220, because the terms employees military-backed the vocabulary religious.
we there fact reference the the& the fiqh the& the particularly the# 91 the judicial islamic, stitch the## the.
and the question could to the the the the future. ask of know in what able of judges civilians are competent for. express on the& the.
beyond of its aspect religious, the text voted yesterday is very criticised in reason of powers those that the the the it over the president of the republic.
the brotherhood muslim are her that they are far reduced in comparison of this that the the the they were under the the the the former regime.
another point issue: the powers entrusted to the the the the army.
with the wish of military, the the the the up the budget of the defence not will not to the parliament, but to a council national of defence.
not more that not will banned the trial of civilians in of courts military, as the wondered the associations of defence of rights of the the the the human.
these last are also on of their concerns to about the text, that the the the they groups which.
the crime of blasphemy is at and the the the the insult is now banned, this which could have of serious consequences on the freedom of the the the expression, of the press particularly.
of more, no article not fact more has to the protection of women, would heba morayef, of watch rights watch.
according it, the only point positive is the the the the ban of the torture by the the the the article 36.
the word not was not in the previous constitution.
then that the president egyptian to if the the the express yesterday evening to the television, of demonstrations are more this afternoon.
the support the head of the the the the state défileront them, saturday.

then that the members and the activists of rights human polémiquent on this that will give the law with the test language compulsory, of perpetrators selling of the& the not the& the certificates have already fact their appeared in the countries
every year, 13 million of workers migrants come to moscow, petersburg and of the the the other cities russian.
the most the time, this are of nationals of the the the the asia central: uzbekistan, tajikistan and turkmenistan.

this initiative of the the the introduce of out has been supported by the members of the duma of the the the state and the service federal of migrations.
but, before that the law between in force, the defenders of rights of the the the the human have already to of many times asked the question in the press: that the the the what that it will give?
that the the the what that the the the the obligation of know the russian will for the russian and the immigrants?
all of the the the first, say the representatives the service migratory, this will of reduce the number of people suffering the& the of the the the the slavery the work the& the.
many speak of defence of rights of workers migrants, explains the director the office the service federal russian of migrations the tajikistan, victor sebelev.
the protection of rights must start before their starting.
only a system of selection organised will of solve to 90% the problems of workers foreign.
the problems. are for the migrants without profession, without training, those which not are not the language and which not the the the have not of certificates medical.
without the understanding of the language, certifie sebelev, the future migrant is for to pass of people dishonest which, under pretext of the the the the help, him supply a the& the travel the& the in a maisonnette held where him and of tens of its fellow. tourmenteront for of months without food and without paper and will trimer between 12 and 14 hours by day.
we receive of many complaints of the on of our migrants.

however, of many nationals of republics of the the the asia central which want come win of the the the the money in russia maintaining that the the the they not are not only not the language the countries where they want. to, but also that the the the they club with difficulty in their own language.
this not the the the is, course not their fault, but, their are: little of turkmen, leaving, mercenaries can. afford of follow not even that the the the a education primary smaller.
in indeed, their families not the the the have even not of what feed their children without about of the to properly and of the equip for the the the the school.
as that the the the they arrive to the the the the adolescence, these young been win of the the the the money as that the the the the opportunity. there.
it the the the is difficult when we not knows not the language, confient-ils.
the& the you you sense by and sad the& the.
the defenders of rights of the the the the human adversely however a aspect important of the law with to the language.
the out will for only to migrants which have a status legal.
without status, it not the the the there will not of the the the up or of work official by the following.
yet, the most of workers migrants still to live in russia of way illegal.
the& the welcome or defence of the the the enter the& the
many of the the the immigrants explain that the the the it not the the the is not if easy of the the the to a status official in russia.
the reason? the barriers administrative and always these difficulties language.
of more, the legalisation costs of the the the the money: between 12 and 16 miles roubles.
and then, we can to a not registration quickly for only 1 500 roubles.
the police russian know that we have of not documents, that we not the the the have not of the the the registration, of the the the where the case of the the the extortionist.

as the first day of the the the the entry in force of the law with to the language, we has discovered that the papers of the the the registration of migrants not the the the were not the only to be not.
several not certificates of the the the out of languages have already been confiscated by the employees the service federal of migrations.
the papers occurs outside of the the the a imprimante colour ordinary.
, course, their new owners not the have not mountains for nothing: every migrant which expecting and. facilitate the task of out has had pay seven thousand roubles for this document.
it the the the is two time and half more expensive that the procedure official: this cost the worker migrant three thousand roubles.
the representatives the power and the defenders of rights of the the the the human if the the the agree for say that the the the the objective to short term is of protect the system against the corruption for that the the the it be impossible of simply buy these the& the robbers of paper the& the.
the authorities can give to workers migrants which not the the the have not could validate the the the the up the first coup the time for follow of in of language.
of more, the immigrants which not are not the russian. will proposed a work in of areas which not the the the involve not of communicate actively with the people.

these the days, a wave of protests is far-right against the low wages abortion by the supermarkets walmart and the being channels of catering rapid such that mcdonald the the the if, cola king, taco bell, wendy the the the if and chicken chicken chicken.
for the at, person not can predict if this wave will take of the the the the that or if the the the nationally quickly.
these actions are supported by the unions and a some number of the the the associations of left.
time to the the the the increase of wages limited that see the employees of basis home walmart and in the channels of catering rapid, the organisers of demonstrations want to the creation of unions.
this sector not the the the is for the the the the at not covered by the movement trade.
46 cent by year?
the demonstrations have started the week last, after thanksgiving, the the& the friday black the& the, the at where a on year of balances if the the the vessel of million of the the the inhabitants if the the the is was on the the the the america and db sometimes of esclandres.

walmart marketed all: of layers to guns of hunting in incidentally by the batteries of car, the vacuum, the eggs and the milk.
the products there are in average 8% to 27% less gentlemen that in the large supermarkets.
it the the the is why many of employees it paid home walmart are their shopping only on their place of work.
the price and the choice of products have fact of walmart the the the the a of groups the more powerful to united.
according the criticism, walmart can. afford of sell its products good market particularly in reason of wages low of its employees.
these the. about also of conditions of work difficult, by example the lack of wheelchair wheelchair or of scanners portatifs.
the participants of demonstrations the the& the friday black the& the wondered a increase of wage, they. are complained the fact that the price of the the the the insurance medical provided by the the the the company had increased of 30 to 100 dollars by months.
for the worker of basis home walmart which affects 9.5$ of the the the the at, it the the the is a amount that the the the it not can not. afford.
of scientists of the the the the university californian of berkley are that if walmart publishers the wage way to 12$ of the the the the at, this cost the group 3.2 billion of dollars.
it the the the is 1.1% of more of this that the the the it big currently.
if walmart transférait any the the the the increase of wages on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the shop their would to 46 cent of more.
they spend in a year only 12,39 dollars of more that now.
the supporters of walmart adversely with satisfaction that the protests have had place in only nine states and not the the the have of no damaging the group.

the protests. are continued this week to new york and concerned not more the shops walmart( in this city gradual, they not are not very appreciated, it the the the is why they not the the the there are not still buildings) but the mcdonald the the the if and other restaurants good market.

jumaane williams, member the council city of new york
currently, the wage minimum provided by the legislation federal and the of new york is of 7,25$ of the the the the at.
the fast-foods the increase with the time, but of little, in average its employees of basis do to new york 8,90$ of the the the the at.
person not affects less that the the the them in this city.
for me it the the the is not of live with this amount to new york.
it was a time where almost a quarter of young americans physician home mcdonald the the the if after the school all in living home their parents.
little of people there supposing their source main of income or wanted there remain for long.
today the the the today, i i at to interviewer of employees of mcdonald the the the if which. about of duty live with this wage and of sometimes duty feed their children with.
of the the the another on, on the forum the newspaper street street newspaper we is of comments saying that the the the it is irresponsible of do of children if you not know not with what you will the feed.
the demonstrators which have launched the movement thursday to 6h30 almost the mcdonald the the the if of the 40th street and on madison avenue demanded that the what and the cuisiniers the burger are paid the minimum 15$ of the the the the at, be a increase of more of two time that the wage minimum current.
they wondered also to this that are created of unions in the sector of the catering rapid.
the law american from to the the the the administration of the the the there do obstacle and of punish the expresses of the the the a union by of horrifying or of redundancies.
however, the the the the administration their for rarely the life.
for a union, if the the the take of the catering rapid still a task difficult, and it, for of reasons concrete.
the the the the a of main is the the the the extraordinary rotating the staff.
they not are not of the the the agreement
of the the the other demonstrations tumultueuses. example almost of several of the the the other channels of catering rapid.
the at phare of the protest has been the country in middle of day almost the mcdonald the the the if of times clearest with the the the the intervention of several political democrats local, particularly the of jumaane williams, member the council city, which has said: the& the mcdonald the the the if announcement sell of billion of portions and after they not you give even not of maternity disease and not you pay not the work that you have fact honestly! the& the.
the demonstrators have been supported by of the the the other democrats new-yorkais in view, particularly by the candidate the post of mayor optimism of blasio which has said that the& the we must all support the employees of the catering rapid for that the the the they which a wage just and the welfare economic that deserves every new-yorkais.
the new york times has characterised this demonstration as the more important that the the the has known the sector of the catering rapid in any its history.
but only few hundreds of people there have part without be that all not the the the were not of employees of burger, which employ of tens of thousands of people to new york.
it is for the the the the at difficult of say if this spark of movement of mass will of small.
the& the for the at, we not the the the sometimes that moyennement to deceive the brain the& the
recently, the adore of new technologies. are used to connection the reality increased to through of glasses special.
the starting, it the the the is google which has accounts this been its model current at of its conference by and in november we has learned that microsoft had fact the request the patent.
however, it from of the the the the maintenance with the director the group of technologies of 3d interactives the laboratory microsoft of cambridge, shahram izadi, that for the scientists of this society, the glasses are already of the the the the history old.
they are tempted by the perspective of manipulating of objects virtual in the the the the air to hands glossing, by the creation of the the the space virtual open.
- could we say in few words this that fact your group of research?
- we working on the the the the interaction between the the the the human and the machine and we try in the even time of the the the extending the borders of this interaction.
the the the the humanity in its together in is has for the at to pixels on but skip and sometimes the tactile.
we want look 5 to 10 years before we and tell the changes radical which. thaw with this interaction.
by example, the vacuum xbox and the sensors kinect are a not in before, and almost no xbox not. sells today the the the today without kinect because all the world if the the the interested to the borne by the gesture.
- that we reserve also the the the the future?
-, that the kinect has visited the the the the interaction physical, many of things. a on but skip, sometimes in 3d.
the informed of the the the the information has been improved( the system receiving more of data), but the at, for the the the the at, not really.
we try of change it and we working on of systems of the the the display really 3d consumers on different technologies, particularly the technologies of projection.
it must do out the world technology in the we, in the world physical, the to more tactile.
for this, however, it must identify not only the the the the user, but also the the the the space which the the the the surrounds.
and, we can it the world real by of objects virtual in a form more practice.
and for start, ourselves of these mindless helmets of reality virtual!
- that you of the borne voice-controlled?
it is valued, but not the the the is not overestimated?
we not can not say that this be the panacea: the question of confidentiality. ask because that the the the we not the the the has not always to of the the the informed the other of its actions or of its intentions.
in fact, every type of the the the interaction with the the the the computer is good, but everyone in its niche.
by example, for wheelchair the devices in the places public, we had a project for which we pensions to of gestures, not of gestures broad, but rather to of gestures discreet, abysmal.
the gestures not the the the were not governing by the camera of the the the the equipment, but by a bracelet of to the hand which risen the movements of bones and of muscles.
it is currently great, but it is theoretically possible of the reduce to the size of the the the a shows.
in fact, the future will marked by the borne joint, by example: gesture+ votes.
- it the the the is to say?
- by example, of what way i demanderiez-vous of you to this canette?
you the would with the floor and with the gestures.
- of the the the usual, i about only.
- oh, it will be difficult to recognise.
- therefore, you want force the users to if the the the adapt in office of this that the machine can or not not do to a at given?
- not apos, but it if the the the is of the the the a rapprochement each.
i think that very soon we have work to the the the the development of new types of sensors which we will of better identify the responses of the the the the human.
it can if the the the act by example of sensors laser, they produce a enough good resolution in depth and it the the the is very important.
- if we if the the the interested to your work on the sensors xbox kinect, that the the the what that you not the the the like not in the cameras modern?
they lack of resolution, of depth or still of the the the another thing?
- in principle, it the the the is on the generation current that we we are in our work on the recognition 3d.
it would course, of the the the to about 8 mégapixels with a speed of quot it/ if.
but the problem not the the the is not the mégapixels themselves, but, the quality of the form and the depth.
by report to this last point, all the technologies current are enough good, this rajoute the work to who of the the the algorithmes.
it must keep to the the the the spirit the resolution according the by x and there, but also z.
the speed any also many, the number of managers to the second.
the movements human are enough dynamic, and the 30 it/ if not enough really not, especially for the gestures.
tabling bathiche, of our laboratory of redmond has given the affect of sensors a delay field of treatment including between 1 and 100 µs, the sensors current being more almost of the second value( 60-100).
all the world not includes not to what point this influence the the the the interaction of the the the the human and of the machine.
i the the the would, need of the the the a equipment of this type in my work, but not require not of affect, for have more of managers to the second.
- but not we not increase the number of cameras?
- the kinect has today the the the today three the& the cameras the& the, which the the the the a is in fact a roadside infrarouge and the second, a récepteur the signal will.
and the third camera is in fact a raluca-ioana as the scope visible.
it not is not to need the depth of the the the the subject.
many of cameras could solve this problem ...
or the the the the worse in by the volume required of calculations.
it would interesting of create a product flexible similar the kinect, of play with the we of cameras and of see how this could help to need the emplacements.
- as that i i can, microsoft, to the difference of google, not the the the has not presented its glasses the public.
not you not that of the the the a point of view of the the the the use daily of technologies of the reality increased, the glasses are the the the the a of platforms such the more of prospects?
-, course,. walk all the time with a smartphone the hands show not the the the is not practice but this this that i think: the better option would a reality increased the& the transitional the& the which you would to from of the the the a platform cloud of to of glasses the smartphone.
the glasses are a equipment very staff and it the the the is it which fact their force( the elements personal are those that you are the only to see) and in even time their weakness: the reality increased to from of glasses not you will not of work on of objects virtual in cooperation with of the the the other people.
- imagine a at that the manipulate of objects holographiques virtual in the the the the air not be more accessible that the the the to tony stark in iron man but also the simple stranded.
it there has a problem on which the opponents to this idea directions the finger: it not the the the there has not of left tactile!
the hands not directly nothing!
what answers your group prépare-t-il by report to this challenge?
- in my in, i say often that the reality increased is the seventh breakthrough in the the the the interaction between the the the the human and the machine.
i think that the eighth could very, be the the the the addition of feelings tactiles.
for the at, the the the the a of technical interesting is the the the the use of the second hand for serve of support of the the the image.
it at perfectly the pressure!
but it there has also of technologies which are really for to given of the palpabilité to these the& the images in the the the the air the& the: by example the the the the jeopardised of several shelves ultrasons political to a point particular where. is the finger and which you gives the left, for the at still low, of the the the a doors of the the the air on the robbers of with.
it there has also the bracelets items on the poignets which influential on the termination nerveuses of with, they are also a an of work such of prospects.
- and you have tried of deceive the brain?
him do believe that the the the it situation this that the the the it should normally feel the at where it has something thing?
- is a good idea, we not the the the have not still tried.
it there has still a task là-dessous on which it will still long. give the it: the way of do believe to someone the the the a which. is mentally in a space very reduced that the the the it that in a space open almost infinitely- we working on the ideas of we of race( nothing to see with those that the the the we is in the clubs of fitness), of platforms mobile and also of marvellous deeper.
for the at, we not the the the sometimes that moyennement to deceive the brain, it still still of many years of work.
is this which makes the work on the reality virtual if interesting for the sufficiently: many of things are still to the the the the state absolute of ivf.
the is the feel and not of the culture- rosbalt.ru
the& the rosbalt the& the continues the project the& the the the the the vanguard pétersbourgeoise the& the dedicated to citadins which. are in ahead, to the the the the vanguard of the culture and of the the the the art.
this list ultra-sélective has already welcomed of the the the bring actors of the stage artistic of petersburg which the achievements will beyond of the border of the city and which have found a recognition in europe, after have been known in any the russia.
the new heroes of the& the rosbalt the& the is the apos extraverti kirill miller.
any the city knows kirill miller, this human rather barbu, all of red vêtu that the the the the we can pass almost the museum russian, the screen of the the the been or still in the and and vernissages branchés.
the tables of kirill miller are always the is, what that be their place of the the the exhibition.
it is the the the the a of conteurs pétersbourgeois structure social and there, the the the the a of founding of new myths.
kirill miller is a prominent representative of the the the the vanguard pétersbourgeoise of the end of years 1980s and the beginning of years 1990.
it is also the symbol of the city, its appeared fact smile the inhabitants and the the of good me.
it has recently taken in its hands a brought of barbarity and it is become the symbol of this instrument to petersburg since the the the it had enough incorporated for this role difficult of by its existence, its philosophy and its image of forest.
- kirill, why what that you drafted the city all in red and not in jaune or in blue turquoise by example?
- i the the the i chosen the red as tailor-make tourism-related in the the the the aspect and the the the the image.
in this world, the red is a compromise between the apos, the which of the the the image and the society.
even if in the society, all this which not the the the is not grey does the the the the aggression and a stir negative.
but my provocation are for to begin the debate.
any the the the the history of my actions provocatrices is a invitation to the debate.
- and when you including that you had be apos?
- to the the the the exhibition the palace of the culture nevskiy where. were my work.
i the the the i including that it the the the was my way.
then, the wave of old painters not official was last and the new, free, in my kind, were incompris.
i the the the i started to i link of the the the friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of the postgazonevchtchina which has given birth to the& the pouchinskaya-10 the& the and then it not the the the there has more had of wave.
i i the the the interested the theatre, to the fashion, to the music, to all the gender except to words.
- and all it if the the the is found in your hospital artistic ...- it the the the was important for me of i find the centre of the culture of petersburg where must. an the best forces créatrices.
in 1995, i the the the i taken taken place to pouchkinskaya-10 which ironically before the work a club music and artistic, a club forest, the house of the bohemia pétersbourgeoise.
many there are born: the name, tequila-jazz, i see still chnour happen with the project the& the the the the the blind of van gogh the& the.
chnour and its friends trumpet-blowing of songs easy in play-back in of maillots moulants, they have among them igor vdovin, composed today the the the today to the fashion.
when the group has started to. produce in marches, it is become the& the leningrad the& the.
trakhtenberg animait not it of the the the emissions before the the the the time of hali gali.
we their have given trakhtenberg and it the the the is then that its great career has started, but its training and its education of basis, it the the the is home we that the the the it the has received.
galérie the& the d137 the& the, club the& the griboïedov the& the: this are of consequences of the hospital artistic.
our employees there are parties in as that the the the used.
i am a heroes the century past, of the the the the time where the culture he say something thing.
in 2000, a poll has been organised in the press: it the the the was the price the& the the people of our city the& the.
i the the the i been appointed the& the apos of the the the the year the& the, and it the the the is then that my is has taken end.
this not the the the is not convenient of work in a new time with of the the the old rules, i am a representative of the truth, of the the the the honesty and of the culture the century past.
today the the the today, it the the the is easy of become popular, but the culture and the popular are of things different, we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- thy work. listed by a lifestyle recognisable.
- many of my tables are of hits, they have a up and a her very strong.
i will have a exhibition appeals the& the the museum russian to through the clowns the& the.
the clowns belong to a category timeless.
before i the the the was someone the the the a of social, today the the the today it fact it and it fact fear of the the the be and.
but with the clowns, all if the the the erased, the tragic-.
i the the the like the that, i the the the i of ideas odd.
by example, the the the the idea of save the world via the déguisement total and compulsory.
today the the the today, it the the the is the the the the masquerading which any, we if the the the interested the mechanism outside, but not to the the the the internal of the person.
perhaps that the the the we not can not him give the hand, but that the the the it must rather him poison to the tronche.
and the lies will effacé by the déguisement.
- recently we t the the the have seen in the role the his of the the the brought of barbarity.- a city cultural must have this type of heroes.
which of the the the another that me can the play.
- but perhaps that the the the the art commercial can also be like?
- today the the the today the the the the art commercial must be treated, delicate, liquoreux.
a disintegration of the culture is in is of. produce.
before, the people were shared in herds, the supporters of the bohemia aimaient a thing, the conversely a another.
today the the the today, all is divided in micro-communautés, it the the the is difficult of please to all the world.
i not am not a ticket of% dollars for please to all the world.
today the the the today, it must think to which you quot please.
every steal has 100 adore.
- but several thousands of people come see stas mikhaïlov!
- this are of people that the the the we has lowered which come the see, it the the the is the on sexual and social which that.
but for the on cultural, 300 people will, 10 miles not will not and the end the account it the the the is less of management, of the the the money, all neglect.
i the the the i my adore, the main it the the the is of not not the deceive, of not not spoil the experienced.
when i the the the was young, i peignais of tables that the the the a collectionneur has on to on of falk or of larionov.
i the the the i started with the tables which of the the the usual are those that the the the we starkly in end of life.
today the the the today, we be often the ideas.
we said: it there has the culture badly, the culture of consumption.
the consumption not the the the has not of culture, it not the the the has nothing to see.
i am a representative of the culture of the the the yesterday, i the the the i grew with the the the the example of painters which living in the poverty and were in the poverty and which guatemala the the the the money rightly for the painting.
i am for this culture.
- kirill, that the the the what which lack to petersburg?
- of good experts cultural.
it there has this concept: the official of the culture.
but all not can not work in the culture.
under the is of good tsars, this not the the the was not as it, the tsars not understand not, the culture, but they understand that the the the it we keep the good experts.
to moscow, it there has today the the the today of good consultants.
we have of people here to petersburg which could be experts, but they are characterised, because it must of experts more high which évalueront properly these experts and their fraieront a way.
currently, it the the the is the the& the is the feel the& the which flower.
the even erarta, but they. differ in this sense that the the the they say honestly that the the the they not are not all the the the the art kristen, that the the the it there has of painters which must. find of the the the other museums.
- for you, that the the the what that it the the the is petersburg?
- petersburg not the the the is not the capital cultural, it there has to moscow, more of culture, it there has a soil for this.
and on our stones, the the the the art has the it to all.
we have need of the the the a soil cultural and we have more of the the the writers that of players, it the the the is bad.
in europe, it there has many of curious which will see of exhibitions, of testing.
home we, this layer is very with.
we must to the the the the art to the fashion as it the the the was the case the beginning the century last.

the earth is in danger.
warming climate or severity with a asteroid evil.
of caravans of navettes space with of terriens to on been to the research of the the the a planet of rescue.
for save the the the the humanity, a great question. ask: how continue to do live our species in gravity or still on a planet of rescue?
i believe that the the the it not the the the there not many the choice.
it there has in fact two real milky that the the the the we can obtain, not even that by hypothesis.
the& the it if the the the is of venus and of march the& the, estimated vladimir anti-crisis, sufficiently of the the the the institute as of the the the state p.k. chternberg( gaich).
if on march the conditions are more for for the life, the temperature to the surface of venus is of 500.
we not can there live that the the the to very high at or on the the the the orbit of venus ... in the the the the space.
we has started to if the the the interest to questions of the reproductive in the the the the space in. focusing on the fauna.
it there has still a at, we torry of experiences on the plants.
four generations of small pound longer on orbit not. différenciaient in no way of hybridise terriennes.
then, we has set on orbit of insects, of small flies drosophiles reproductrices.
in 1979, of eggs of caille have been sent in the the the the space for see how. has a an in gravity.
we also to the opt-out a poussin all to fact normal.
it the the the is then that the problems starting.
the& the the problem is linked the fact that the poussin must find a support, it must. to on its turtle and start to you the& the, explains the director the laboratory of the the the the institute of problems médico-biologiques of the the the the academy of sciences of russia( imbp) vladimir sychev.
in not pre-emptive no support, the poussins if the the the agitaient of way chaotic.
and the end of 10 hours, the new born supposing their instincts fully if the the the stagnate.
the poussins not fluctuations or to the light or the its.
unfortunately, they kills all simply the end of quattre days.
the& the we their have widened the eyes two time, then we have abandoned, because it the the the is all simply impossible of work with them there the& the, explains vladimir sychev in distributed the the the the failure of the the the the experience with the poussins in the the the the space.
the last the& the noah small-scale the& the into with of animals has been sent on orbit it there has 16 years.
the experiences. will the spring 2013.
however, the biosatellite the& the bion the& the not the the the embarquera that of species the even sex.
it there has had a experience with of rats sent with their unborn in the the the the space.
in principle, we not the the the has discovered nothing of surnaturel.
the& the it if the the the was still of biosatellites and then it the the the is the only experience. it must out this kind of research the& the, fact out vladimir sychev.
after the the the the aircraft, the rats of the the the the space have given birth to their offspring.
however, we not adequately not still to out of reproductions directly in the the the the space.
this not the the the is not a easy case.
in losing their middle as, the animals not are more in able of to their instinct sexual.
contrary to animals, the the the the human in is able, in principle.
the the the the enduring sapiens has the thought abstract, it is able of create a substance emotional things.
this type of the the the experience not the the the is not achieved for of reasons ethical.
but the women will in the the the the space since already 50 years.
the more carry risk has been taken by terechkova.
and the the the the body try is this that the the the the humanity has of more valuable.
our mouette if the the the is gone and person on earth not could say if the the the it take after a flight in the the the the space.
if it have could give birth to a child after the flight.
the& the person not responded to this question the& the, explains vakhtang vatchnadzé, pensioner the sector of rockets and of the the the the space.
in june 1964, just a year after its flight in the the the the space, the first woman cosmonaute valentina terechkova- birth to a small daughter.
the father of the the the the child, andrian nikolaïev was also cosmonaute.
in 1988, the second woman cosmonaute svetlana savitskaya, after have been two time on orbit and have even worked in middle extra-véhiculaire,- birth to a son.
however, the risk on.
we have little, even very little of cosmonautes which not the the the have nothing had and which give birth to a settle in full health after of long flights.
the& the and if the the the they are more long, this there a danger even for the flights in orbit the& the, concludes the pilot and cosmonaute, heroes of the the the the union soviet and heroes of the russia, valeriy poliakov.
yet, the the the the humanity must seek of new solutions in the biotechnology, the protection against the radiation and the creation of the the the a gravitation would.
laboratory of the the the hydrologie the centre of preparation of cosmonautes: step compulsory of the preparation the flight.
here, in flottabilité nowhere, the cosmonautes if the the the cause to signs extra-véhiculaires.
the the the the water imite the the the the gravity.
if for the adults, the the the the water is comfortable but however a middle abroad, for the infant, it the the the is their real part.
the small men amphibies seem the confirm: the life on earth from of the the the the ocean.
in the able where the baby evolved about 9 months in the liquid lymphatique the womb of its mother, it him is more easy of if the the the used then to the the the the water.
it the the the is in principle logical, because since its birth until the the the to its first bathroom, it. is only 2 weeks.
the& the it the the the is very little for forget the& the, explains the the the the instructeur of were for infant, marina aksenova.
in a word, if for the the the the child which has of born the the the the gravity is a state more natural, the woman has need of gravitation, of the the the a force of weight.
in gravity, the muscles the womb, the basin if the the the atrophient very quickly, the capacity of order the baby. is.
good of the the the agreement, idea it in we based on the simulateurs of the the the delivery.
we can, course prepare a delivery in a house special, the woman will to the do out.
the& the and then? the& the request valeriy poliakov for to to think on this question complex.
of the the the a another on, the the the the child also has need of the the the a gravitation would.
if the the the it not situation not the the the the attractive earthly, the the the the body not form not the flesh or the system musculaire.
we not can not to a cot as a adult with a combination special for the training.
it will all simply private of its needs very.
the& the and this experience that we envisagerions in this case in imaginant the birth of the the the a child in a environment abroad will the return on earth of the the the a child disabled, fully désadapté the& the, plans the director the committee for the bioethics of the the the the institute of problems médico-biologiques of the the the the academy of sciences of russia, igor pestov.
the birth of children in the the the the space to still of the theory.
however, with the time this become reality, when the terriens. realise in their navettes to a planet grows which become the the the the housing of their settle was in the the the the space.
the head of the the the the isc( institution higher of control of finance public) has said: the& the the control the pseudo work independent( in czech the& the system švarc the& the) has failed to because of politicians.
in the area of markets public, the republic czech have of the the the inspectors competent and of the the the a legislation of quality but it is to the lagging for this which is of its application.
it the the the is this that the the the has said miloslav kala, the vice-president of the the the the institution higher of control of finance public in a interview for aktuálně.cz.
the& the the law not will never perfect, but its application must be just and, to my opinion, it the the the is this which fact not home we the& the, has said kala in its comment of the situation current.
a control they jointly by of inspectors czechs and germans suggest also of conclusions similar.
it quote as example of practice stabilise the the the the approach the the& the system švarc the& the by petr nečas.
mr the first minister has recently said that the the the the ods not the the the was not make the entrepreneurs with of controls the what therefore allowed or from?
the& the the law must, be applied of the the the a way or of the the the a another, then if it from something thing, even the head the government not can prevent of the the the act a authority known of the the the go inspected of the the the demand the respect of the law the& the, note kala.
at of the meeting of the commission of control to the house of members, you have mentioned a project tchéco-allemand in the framework which have been this the legislation in on of markets public of these two countries.
of what focus question what?
it if the the the is of the the the a control linked that we have launched it there has of this about two years.
in terms simple, the legislation european plans of what way manage the markets public and of legislation national particular and that the the the a practice this apos him are following.
we have drawn all this and, that this procedure of control not be not still completed, of differences very interesting we are there: generally very, our legislation is perhaps the& the more strict and of better quality the& the, however, according some parameters, the practice as such is better in germany.
this confirms therefore that the the the it not enough not to work continually of rules of more in more detailed but that the the the it is necessary of. spend to the implementation in application even the right.
in what this project he you help what and that the the the in résulte-t-il for you?
a control common of this type should rightly contribute to this that we emission-free of we make of out the laws, of led and of the the the improve the values, when this not the the the has not a indeed really positive.
the principle of good management means to the thing in question to a price reasonable( this which not wants not always say the more low), order of the the the exclude all enrichment and a will activity criminal.
but in cut the values of markets, we not the the the will not necessarily this objective.
it. could that this system. is to such point by by the tape, that those which in seek the failings will many more of the the the opportunities that if the threshold was left more high.
you about of problems internal on the implementation in practice of the legislation of markets public.
how works the system of control in germany?
there a institution and to our isc or a fashion of the the the organisation different?
for this which is of institutions, possible to the the the the isc, works there the bundesrechnungshof which is organised similairement, it have also of the the the a council been a little differently, but these two institutions lay-offs basically of way and.
the competences are also, in a some able, similar, with a nuance however by report to our system: the the the the germany being a structure federal, it have therefore also of in of accounts of this type the level of different länder.
the brh can only control the the the the money federal, this which corresponds home we to resources of the the the the state.
the funds public nationally-geared home we by the regions and the municipalities, are there controlled the level of in of accounts of länder.
in this which concerns the legislation national, is more simple that the we?
i not like not do of comparison general without data concrete, however, in some areas, the the the the germany is often was as a model but we not can certainly not say that the the the it would better in all the areas.
it the the the is can be had the fact that the the the they have of better inspectors?
not, certainly not, but i repeat, i not have not of data of comparison.
however, it must say also that this countries that we be as a model is also has to any a series of problems.
otherwise they not the the the would no advantage to cooperate with our institution, not?
in this which concerns the legislation national, that the the the has what for you, in as that the the the institution, the the the the amendment of the law on the markets public, its effects. what already feel?
this amendment being entered in force relatively recently, it not the the the has not still of the the the impact on our operations of control.
as we make of controls has would, it must be with a some delay.
our comments concern only, for the at, the process of preparation of future controls- we have launched a new instrument of the& the detection of risks of bad management the& the with which we have past the screened almost of 14 000 markets public- that these changes. will, course feel, because that the values have been modified and that the conditions of some types of procedures of the the the appeals of the the the tender and and of following.
what that therefore you reigns the the the the adoption of this law rather as a advantage or as a more of burden for the the the the administration?
i think that this law is a not in the good direction and i the the the hope that the the the the future the will.
the problem which can can is that these rules increasingly more tougher and that the the the it not be not possible of the respect.
already under the regime of the regulation previous, the provider( by example the council regional, in the case of programmes operational regional) contraignait the issues controlled to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach to the discipline budgetary.
is therefore really useful of to the law more strict of this way?
not, not of this way, i think.
the system must exclude those which want with the system or in be but not punish those which makes of errors formal without result on the process decision-making.
a such system will to of the the the advantage of pressure on the the the the administration.
what is therefore the solution for if the the the in out?
let to where we not the the the will not.
recently, the first minister has said that the the the the ods not the the the was not make the entrepreneurs with of controls the so-called system švarc- that the the the what that this means?
the system švarc is banned or that?
the law must, be applied of the the the a way or of the the the a another, then if it from something thing, even the head the government not can prevent of the the the act a authority known of the the the go inspected and of the the the demand the respect of the law.
it can say: the& the we will change the law and the the the the allow the& the, but it not can say that we will act as if of nothing not the the the was.
the law on the markets has of rules relatively strict on the formal to for and this, rightly order of protect the the the the appeal of the the the tender.
but it is by, tragic that the the the a bidder be eliminated only for because of defects formal.
the law not will never perfect, but its application must be just and it the the the is, to my opinion, this which fact not home we.

šimon ornest has said: the& the in together, we want gather of the the the the energy positive. the& the
that you the fact that in less of the the the a months this should be the end the world?
this not the the the is that the the the a of these new alarming, the kind of traps in which we like do.
in our group; tap tap, we in rigole rather and we. said that we are the only group able of gather a still of the the the energy positive order of can or of the the the prevent the end the world.
of more, you parthenon in december a project all to fact single: three testing against the end the world.
you present more in detail this project to our players?
it the the the is a action boot that we preparing since already two years.
we have decided of the the the use the potential marketing of the end the timetable inhabited announced for the 21 december to 11 hours 10 the morning.
the on, the 20 december, three testing. will same, to prague, brno and ostrava.
they. philosophise almost the at where will end the timetable inhabited on the the the the island of kiribati which. is in the the the the ocean peaceful, on a fuseau keeping in ahead of 12 hours by report to we.
which has had this idea?
the starting i think that it the the the was my idea, then we have all designed with our which, honza augusta.
in outside the fact that we want gather enough of the the the energy positive for save the world, we want also together, with the public, think to the the the the state the world that we let to our children.
to the the the the opportunity of the end the timetable inhabited, we have created a where of the the the objects contact, particularly of shoes, t-shirts, bags, and of key originales against the end the world, in the them in line on www.e-tap.cz the people can also we support.
the group; tap tap with of the the the other interpreters has also registered a anthem against the end the world which if the the the apos the& the end the world refinancing the& the( in czech the& the konec světa zrušeno the& the).
it is already very popular on youtube, the the the the heard also at of these testing caritatifs?
, course, all to the end, finally, if we such and that the end the world not the the the has not place ...
it will chantée same by all the interpreters in the three testing.
the anthems. matched also to a at given in the framework of the the the a emission in direct, all to fact single, of the television czech.
the words of this song have been written by tomáš hanák which but also the role main of strangers in the clip, xindl x there chante also ...
how you in came to cooperate with them?
we working with of the the the other people the show-biz czech, in reason the fact that we holding of many testing and events caritatifs ...
we we are of the do part compromises to these projects.
it if the the the is out that the most of the the the between them are interested by a such cooperation and that it the raising.
to what will the profits of these testing against the end the world?
to equip the centre of training studeo which is accessible to people to mobility reduced and which we working to the being in the framework of the the the the institute jedlička, with the the the the association tap, and it since six years.
of teachers. move regularly with of pupils of the the the the institute jedličkův and their are of activities which the interested and the amusing.
the students themselves not the the the have not the means of. to to of in, we try of the help of this way.
in the framework of the the the the for of the construction of the the the the institute jedlička, we transférerons this project in a new building independent.
several groups of music and interpreters payments on stage at of everyone of these testing?
according what criteria, you the choose?
we have tried of the the the work a programme which if the the the address to all the generations, there including the children.
by example, to prague, payments on stage chinaski, support lesbiens, illustratosphere with dan bárta,; tap tap, marián bango and paroubek suchý.
you will all the details on www.kpks.cz.
prepare also to of the the the other the& the megascience events the& the of this kind in the future?
in may, we will for the first time in the framework the spring of prague the that also, we prepare certainly a programme of quality with of from interesting.
we like also play the the the the year next in the house of the republic czech to new york and personally, a time on place to united, i the the the like, combine of testing to washington and to chicago.
your projects international are minimalist, until the the the here you have played by example to madrid, brussels, london and moscow.
; tap tap is however a group up of people disabled.
how gérez-vous the the the the organisation and the logistics of your collection?
this not the the the is not if terrible that it has the the the the air the first first.
we have five member in gavel electricity which the gears must travel in soute, course we trimbalons also many of baggage and of boxes of the the the instruments ....
until the the the here all if the the the is more or less always, past, čsa and british airways were always perfectly prepared for we, they i the the the have étonnés more of the the the a time.
even to moscow, of the the the where we are from recently, all if the the the is past without problems.
thanks to your travel to the the the the abroad, you can compare in what these countries differ for this which is of facilities of the the the access for the people to mobility reduced, of the the the the attitude of the the the the opinion public live to live of people disabled and and of following.
what have been your experiences until the the the to now?
after madrid, luxembourg, london and of the the the other places where all works better that home we, we have rightly been witness to moscow that the the the to the the the the is all not the the the is still that in a phase initial.
by report to prague, moscow is still very little accessible to people disabled the there, it not the the the is not still aware that the the the a person. wheelchair only in gavel electricity in the centre of the city.
they not consider not still as a obviously of give the priority to a person in gavel in a get.
fortunately, there also, a association if the the the restricts of the the the draw the the the the attention on the problems of people disabled is in is of the the the be created.
in what we still up the countries more developed?
it there has many of things for which we are still in delay ...
it is important of mention that the improvements and perfectionnements on always of efforts deployed by the people concerned.
to london and madrid, it is all to fact aware that the people with a it disability. travel only in the space public the they can go to toilets, the museum, not the the the any where ...
this not the the the is when even not very a there that the the the a great number of people disabled part actively to the life social, on this point, you,; tap tap, are rather the contrary to the state-of-the-art the progress!
the respect the public and the facilities of the the the access are a thing, but the situation will really to change when we have among we of sporting, of artists, of actors, of politicians or of experts being.
for the at, this not are that of case isolated of people which have a strong will.
the group; tap tap is currently very popular, clock in backwards of few years, that the the the what which you has prompted in 1998 to create this group?
i the the the i started to work in as that the the the exceptions to the the the the institute jedlička, where i i am found by of many of young prepared to if the the the invest in something thing.
and as i am myself pianist( i play, between other, the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a activity music.
and then, with the time, as said our modérateur láďa angelovič, we has a little lost the control of the situation( laughter).
the success not the the the is has that the the the the in of these last years, if i not i mistaken not?
it the the the is true, the fact of create of links with of singers known and of work actively to the promotion the group we has helped.
we have including that, if a work not the the the is not visible, it the the the is as if the the the it not the the the there not in the substance.
thanks to subsidies of the the the the union european, we can, in more, we afford of the the the have of teachers of quality, of equipment, and and of following.
had for objective of the the the reach a such level with; tap tap?
as the beginning, i the the the i felt that the the the it there had a potential for change the things.
the destinies business is full of trucs which. preda the each the other.
of the the the a some way, it the the the is logical: all this which is new is accepted with careful and it hard long.
few are the projects original, and i the the the will say that tap tap is the the the the a of the the the between them.
the first impression of the the the a person which we has for the first time is course the have, it the the the is natural ...
but the have is completely unnecessary, because that the people with a disability not are not of beings souffrants, abandoned of all, that we must take in have.
this are of people which can live a life to on full and if the the the flourish, to condition of the the the in have the means necessary, course.
i say often that when of people with a disability arrive to to something thing, this not the the the is not only a forward for them but for any the society.
what that your success not the the the is not also had the fact that you are a leader demanding, as you are as by many of people?
if we want do the work of quality, we must be firm in many of areas and demand a some discipline.
but i think that it the the the is all to fact normal.
some people arrive home we with a vision romantic and the head in the clouds and, when they. move account that the the the they must come to repetition two time by week, follow the in preparation and to many of time on the roads for the testing, they lose quickly their enthusiasm.
but it works of the even way in every group which wants work and reach of objectives.
the group; tap tap account currently 20 member.
how of the the the between them were already that in 1998?
a only, láďa angelovič.
we are a group open, the people enter and been, we not the the the there can nothing.
our doors are always open to those which want or would to of we join.
it will the case the on the day provided of the end the world, the thursday 20 december 2012 to from of 21 hours.
this action. place to prague in the the the the arena incheba, to brno to fléda and to ostrava the plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and of the the the other musicians of republic czech.
in end of single, these three cities will wireless by handed audiovisual when will chantée jointly the song the group; tap tap the& the end the world refinancing the& the.
the aim the together is of together of means financial( to up of 25 million czk) for equip the centre of training co-exist studeo which. is to prague in the the the the institute jedlička.
the price of the the the a ticket to this together is of 400 czk, the the the the entry is free for the children until the the the to 12 years, the prévente of tickets is open to bohemiaticket.
the poland and the cosmos.
the week last, at of the meeting of ministers of countries of the the the the agency space european, the poland has been open as twentieth member of this agency, it in is the second state member of the the the the former bloc of the the the the is( the republic czech is become member to on full the 12 november 2008).
the poland had started a close cooperation with the the the the esa in 1994 and the in of years which have followed has part to a number of projects of the the the the agency.
the road of the poland to the the the the space has however started many more early.
already before the second war world, of polish passionate worked on of flights space the they not have not always of understanding.
i like i by example the conference of sarsenbayev šternfeld to the the the the centre as of warsaw, the 6 december he, the in of which it detailed of ideas drawn of its book of the the the vanguard apos the& the introduction to the the the the have the& the.
the developments of this young engineer( born in 1905) laissèrent the auditors froids and of years more later šternfeld. rappela that only the dr jan gadomski if the the the intéressa to its work.
in bg, šternfeld secured in france the price robert esnault-pelterie and andré louis hirsch for its book the& the introduction to the the the the have the& the.
public dr jan gadomski( 1899- 1966) elation by the following a great propagateur of the the the the astronomy and of the the the the have.
it publia of hundreds of the the the articles in the newspapers polish and écrivit of many works on to this discipline scientific.
gadomski is become a propagateur of the the the the have of importance world, its contribution has been particularly rewarded by the fact that its name has been given to the the the the a of cratères of the face hidden of the moon.
as 1925 was built in poland a draisine intended to be with of the the the a driving rocket.
we not knows unfortunately or the the the the author or the details of this project.
it not the the the is not clear not more if the rocket to serve to propulser or slow the draisine.
the only information known on this draisine are those of the press of the the the the time.
to from of he, the the the the artillery polish commença to. spend to rockets.
the research were conducted by the the the the institute komórka techniki uzbrojenia in cooperation with the teachers mieczyslaw wolfke and gustaw mokrzyckiego.
it from of documents conservés that this research had reached the at of testing.
, course, with the the the the arrival of armed german, the research. are stop.
in 1937, the plans of the the the a rocket of hunting photoélectrique, you by the the the the engineer rohoziński, apparurent in the press specialist and the the the the year following was published the the the the book the& the rakieta- torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza the& the of the the the a author horrors leliwy-krzywoblocki.
these two projects had for purpose a use military of engines of rockets.
just before the war, all the projects of the the the use of the technical of rockets were over by the committee scientific advisory provisional( the& the tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy the& the), which coordonnait all the work.
this committee had been created in 1937, but after two years of functioning, the beginning of the war cooking end to its activities.
after the war, of the the the other work on to the the the the aviation were published in the press polish, thanks to the society have polish( polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne).
for the first time, it is question of the the the a society in the number of november 1954 the newspaper problem, in which. are four articles more detailed on to the the the the aviation.
in the the the the a of these articles, writing by the professor mr subotowicze, it is proposed of create a society devoted to the the the the have
to this time, of projects of satellites about had already been with and it was clear that the area of the research space had of the the the the future.
the beginning of the the the the year 1956, the society have polish( pta) déploya of efforts for enter in the federation have international( created in 1951) and as the the the the autumn, the pta in elation a member field.
the the the the year following, the first president of the pta, kazimierz zarankiewicz( 1902- 1959), elation vice-president of the federation have international.
it conserva its office until the the the to its death in 1959.
to from of 1956, the pta apporta a contribution significantly the development supporting of success of the rocket meteorological rm( rakieta meteorologiczna), which elation the first rocket polish to out of research scientists.
the first model, rm-1, was ended in 1957 and the first launching when place the 10 october 1958.
this rocket of the the the a scope of 1800 metres had a length of 80 cm and which a little less of 5 kg.
by the following was built a version improved, rm-1a and, during the the the the been 1959, of testing of flight of the rocket to two two-tier rm-2 were entamés in the desert of bledov.
this rocket had a length of 1.4 from and which probably 11.5 kg.
the prototype with have had be able of the the the out of work scientists concrete- the rocket rm-34 have had have a scope sense until the the the to pence km and serve to observe the were in at.
but in 1963, all the work of development were 2010.
the rocket meteor-1 implementation the point the in of the period judgements- massacres, succéda to first rockets of type rm.
this rocket,- with two two-tier, had a length total of 609 cm and a weight initial of 32,5 kg.
three models( be meteor-1a, -1b and -1c) were developed the they. notable by the presupposes of the the the the space with to tools scientists.
the rocket meteor-1a had of the the the a space respecting a volume of 0.4 litre, while that in meteor-1b this volume was of 0,34 litre and in meteor-1c of 0,62 litre.
the scope maximum of all these types of the the the device was of 37 km.
in the period massacres- 1968, the rockets meteor-2 were put the point in the the the the institute aviation, the first testing of flight débutèrent in october 1970s.
the rocket meteor-2 had a weight initial of live kg and was able of transport a burden useful of 10 kg to a at of the the the about 60 km.
by the following were built the versions meteor-2h and meteor-3.
it be still of mention the the the the entry of the poland the cospar( committee for space research) in 1960 and the creation of the the the a committee national cospar two years more later.
in the framework the programme interkosmos, the poland has also part to the the the the exploration space on the satellites soviet about and, in 1978, the pilot miroslaw hermaszewski elation, after vladimír remek, the second cosmonaute non-soviétique of this programme.
the the the the repeal of the law on the work of the the the use public not the the the is not a solution.
the week last, the court constitutional has terminated the law on the work of the the the use public.
this decision has raised in the the the the opinion public a live debate.
it is without no doubt interesting of the the the examine this issue of the the the a point of view more broad.
the systems economic alcohols to the liberalism, as in the the the the eu that in the context of the globalisation, are from on the principle of more of competition economic not regulated.
this means what that the different entities economic and that the systems economic national are over in conflict the each with the other.
this result the principle of the freedom the trade and of the movement free( without limits) the capital private ally to a speculation financial being.
the differences considerable the price the work( wages) while a tension on the price.
it be of to under this term the meaning following: a producer if the the the best by the the the the import of goods sold to low taken of resist to the competition economic in the& the when more expensive the& the the price the competitor, in the aim of the the the unbelievable a more great on the market and of the the the increase and its own profits.
to great scale, this means for the most of entrepreneurs: be transfer the production to the the the the abroad, be buy to low price, be has. the result is a unemployment important in the countries where the price the work are high in comparison to of the the the other economies.
being given that the capital private not the the the has no responsibility the point of view social and by that even of responsibility live to live the unemployment that the the the it grief, the charges social of the the the the state increase necessarily.
any this situation grows the perfect bad will of gentlemen the entrepreneurs to pay of taxes and to be and the damage economic and social caused to the the the the together of the society by this race the profits.
this situation is to a such point of known public that the the the it not the the the is not necessary of provide of data statistics concrete.
the practices without unscrupulous the capital private causing in the different economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to. to in a competition mutual order of led artificially the level social of their own population in the aim of the the the draw home them the capital abroad.
other said, the governments are their own population to the thank the capital private without take account of the the the the collapse social.
this. it mainly in the amendments of laws in force.
the the the the objective is of force economically its own population to accept the manufacturing of price the capital private, particularly in the area of wages.
this. product of the the the a on by a system of constraints economic in case of unemployment to long-term term and of the the the another on by the restriction of rights of employees in the area of the legislation the work.
it in result a poverty growing and the the the the deepening of differences between the rich and the poor.
in republic, it there since of years of points of distribution public of food for the poor which not can support to their needs with their own work.
we account already by million the number of these people.
in the framework of the the the the increase of the competitiveness of the the the the economy german, it becoming all to fact aware that the employees are of such wages that the the the the state. has forced of pay a also for that the the the they deliver the minimum vital.
a such scandal has by example been set to day in the case of employees work as applaud the parliament federal.
the measures of the the the economy of almost all the states member the south of the the the the eu while, without no doubt, a situation and in which, under the pressure of the the the a collapse catastrophic of the society, the people are forced be of the the the emigrate( as this was the case the 19th century), be of eke with of wages of misery, in for of the society, in the the the the hope that the the the a day the capital private invest in their countries.
it must here. ask the question following: of the the the where will this capital?
if the the the it from of the the the other countries of the the the the eu, then the poverty what of the the the a countries to a another the this capital can not not come not more, or then a chinese, a indian, a african, a turkish, a moroccan, a egyptian or africa will of work for a fraction of the the the a wage european.
this concerns also any the the the the america latin.
the theory liberal and the media are, to if the the the in lasser, that the the the the state not can not do of investment in capital in its own economy, that the the the the economy arrested led to a disaster economic.
the capital private defends fiercely the the the the idea that the the the the state not can not intervene in the the the the economy by of interventions consolidation.
it must then. ask if the capital private not the the the influence not and, even, not is not today the the the today, according its own interests stateless, the policy and by the even, the the the the state all over.
the answer to this question is without no doubt yes.
the evidence in is that the the the it there a lobby almost almighty and now in all the states.
it in result a situation desperate. manifestations in the area of the corruption, by the the the the done of the the the benefits mutual, in the legislation, where all is blame but not offence.
in republic, the situation is such, that the the the in reason the lack of means financial, the ministries national délèguent the the the the development of projects of laws to of than of the the the lawyers closely linked to the the the the industry.
these projects of law are then adopted the from.
the all the power not has not the people, as the say the constitutions of type western, but of powerful groups financial umbrella their own interests.
it is it that the democracies medium-term to the liberalism. see now quickly face to the situation described by appianos in its book apos the& the the crisis of the the the the empire roman the time of respectable and of pompée the& the: the& the the the the the state was since long in full decline and the functions were yearly by the violence.
the by of bribes, the winning invariably illegally, and the stones and the épées were also used for to these cent.
the dessous-de-table and the corruption proliféraient without limits and the people. went to elections with of votes already sold the& the ... ... the& the the people honest not. cherchaient all to to of functions, it in résulta a time that the the the the state our 8 months without consuls the& the .... the the the we commença really to say that the cure to this situation difficult was a autocracy and that the the the it we choose a human protest the& the ... it is true that the the the appianos had to the the the the spirit pompée, but it the the the is respectable which has has mindless the democracy in regime assume.
in conclusion, as in the the the the mythology, the society current is based on the preference the profits staff, without many for the the the the interest of the society in its together.
in its essence, the capital private not the the the is more able of understand and of do her the interests of the society in its together.
it in result, today the the the today as once, a ancient without before of by, without no effort for out of reforms in depth.
we must therefore seek the causes of the the the the emergence of regimes fascists and communists in the liberalisation without unscrupulous of systems economic of 19th and 20th centuries.
in the the the the state current of things, we can consider the disappearance of these systems the profits of democracies of type liberal as a ensure of pause before a new step.
the fact that the by current not completely the the the the possible of hundreds of thousands of future losses in lives human, the crises humanitarian and social which we are today the the the today the witness and that the crimes against the the the the humanity such that we the know of by the the the the history old and recent.
the the the the repeal of the law on the work of the the the use public not the the the is not a solution, the less to long-term term.
under the pressure of the competition economic, as the plan international that the the the the level internal european, the government of the republic czech will forced of continue to to of means of reducing the level social of the population.
this trend is in indeed systemic.
the solution is in of reforms to be rooted, which will the investment in capital of the the the the state in the the the the economy, curtailed the the the the influence of citizens on the government and remit the position of monopoly the capital private in the society the profits of the the the the state.
israel: laboratory the chaos.

following to the last wave of violence between israel and the strip of gaza, as of the the the usual, of many responses. are high.
some are the party of the the the israel, also of its right to the the the the defence and plaçant the palestinians in the role of terrorists, of the the the other supports the palestinians, referring the racism of the the the the state of the the the israel, the genocide committed against the arab of palestine and dismiss israel as a state terrorist.
i not want not think on the question of know which is guilty and which is victim, in its waves of from a the amount any, the current inhabitants of the the the israel, there including those of territories autonomous, are born in the there situation policy and not the the the have not experienced the opened of violence.

some of these thoughts if the the the based on of facts historical available to the the the the study, of the the the other mutual of my own understanding of that, or more exactly the group of the the the individuals, which is the main instigator of events of the the the the history modern.
the the the the history of the the the the humanity is before all the the the the history of the the the a fight for the power.

this which not the the the is not if obvious is of know if these individualités sharing of way independent or if the the the they had their acts the booming to someone the the the a which pursuit their acts in office of the the the objectives had defined.
we must admit that we live to a time where the wealth world is concentrated between the hands of few individuals and that this concentration financial engendrant some powers not the the the has not could. do the in of the the the a only generation.
among the families with a wealth as. differ particularly the family rothschild, which could be considered as the head of the pieuvre( i the the the not if these families have still a leader but i not the the the the excluded not).

the first war had for objective of the the the out the large monarchies weaponry of the the the europe, the second to if the colonial, particularly british, and the third should reduce the population world between 1 and threshold billion of the the the individuals( a such amount of the the the slaves is sufficiently for their luxury and comfort), create a only religion universal( the the the the œcuménisme not the the the being nothing of the the the another that the the the the beginning of the the the a such solution) and, the final, over a power absolute.
the method used by the clan of families the more rich with to their head the rothschild is to create a crisis then to propose then a solution( order ab chaos- the the the the order with the chaos).
these solutions are incorrect and lead always to a here of the situation( see the creation of the edf intended to avoid that not. repetition not of crises as those that the the the they provoquèrent in 1907).
after have succeeded to remaining the first war world by the the the the murder to sarajevo of ferdinand, colonel habsburg-lothringen the booming austro-hungarian, they détruisirent the russia having in has the revolution bolchevique.
the first war world. termina did by a unconditionally german without to economic and military( the war not the the the was more necessary to the destruction of the russia having) and it was followed by the sky of the the the the divide, the power of the the the europe central.
for a break more easy of the second war world, the bankers have left the politicians create a situation of conflict latent: they have, of the the the a on, imposed to the the the the germany of enormous granted of war old-style and the conditions of the the the a radicalisation of masses impoverished( it their enough then of to a leader enough protest, showing the finger of guilty, proposing of solutions simple) and, of the the the another on, they créèrent a czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, there including of the the the a strong minority german which to play the role( that the the the it tint indeed) of fifth rely for to the fire to, and remaining a war.
to the end the 19th century, the rothschield inspirèrent the creation the movement sioniste, which the the the the a of branches aspira to the creation of the the the a state jewish, of preference in the region of the judée historic with jerusalem as capital( return to sion).
the statement of balfour mentioned above groundwork the for of the the the a migration mass of jews to the palestine and the first friction with the population local arab commencèrent.
of acts terrorists were committed of on and of the the the another.
the second war world éclata the it is difficult of the the the appreciate if hitler has broke the channels in which the bankers international the the the the had held initially the or if all this that the the the it has fact was significance, the fact is however that the suffering of jews of the the the europe in the camps of concentration créèrent the for of the the the the acceptance of the the the a state jewish by the community world.
israel was officially founded in 1948 the of the even way that the granted of war imposed to the the the the germany were to the the the the origin of the second war world, the foundation of the the the the state of the the the israel has glows a homes of the the the had could cause a third war world.
if the bankers international as to remaining this war, the population jewish will as it the was the in of the second war world, the first victim of fighting, this time of even that the population arab or generally muslim the way east.
israel is as a huge laboratory, the source of discord and of chaos, not only in this countries, but the level international( it enough of see how the people. – fiercely between supporters and defenders of the the the israel).
which is guilty and which is victim in the conflict israeli-palestinian, where a wrong grief a another wrong according a circle of violence without end and where we is, to the the the the origin of all, the greed of some individuals and their desire of the the the over the power on the world over?
it must here do the difference between the simple citizens of the the the israel and their leaders, because that as home we, the bankers international not are to people to elections that their own candidate.
the the the the current first minister of the the the israel is a example typical of papers fascisant, balanced live to live of bankers international, which fact all order of remaining a war with the the the the iran, which could, in reason of the the the the accession of this countries to the the the the organisation of cooperation of shanghai( china, india, russia, pakistan, etc ...) if the the the expand for become a conflict world and, being given that the the the the iran control the strait of the the the ormuz by which transite 20% of all the oil world( this have shipyard not the the the has a breadth that of 2 miles) and lead a destruction of the the the the economy world.

in their idea, the new order world is a world of keywords and of the the the slaves.

the film argo: when all will the more it, call hollywood.
in november 1979, a on of demonstrators consisting of the the the students islamic a of the the the storming the the the the embassy american of tehran and retint in hostages 52 diplomats.
they had be released in exchange the shah, mohammad reza pahlavi, which, after the revolution, had fled to united, which supported its regime since several decades.
the situation not the the the version not to the the the the administration american of the the the out positive, it not could not, in indeed, should the shah, because that the the the it have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in of the the the other countries.
however, in iran, where the revolution had was on the the the the establishment of the the the a regime buttiglione, it not the the the was in able of the the the to the release of hostages.
it the the the was a coup heavy for the prestige of united, coup still robustness more later by the fiasco of the attempt of release of hostages by the force.
the diplomats at were finally released intended days more later, following to negotiations organised by the government algerian.
their fate suscita to united a wave of solidarity and a feel anti-iranien.
the occurred iranian contribua very to the defeat of jimmy jimmy face to ronald reagan to elections presidential of 1980s.
the film argo, of the the the the player and 77-year-old in stage ben affleck, describes a episode of this history which offrit a small victory to the the the the america.
just before that the the the it not be occupied, six employees if the the the échappèrent of the the the the embassy.
after of passage complicated, they. retrouvèrent in the residence of the the the the ambassador the canada.
in cooperation with the authorities canadian, the cia parvint to the do out of the the the iran thanks to a cover rocambolesque: they quittèrent the countries with of passports cad in as that member of the the the a team of filmed came do of repérages for the filmed of the the the a film to great a of fiction.
combination of gender
the plan of the the the the expert in exfiltration tony mendez requit the cooperation of the the the hollywood.
order of to the who more credible, of magasines specialist utter state of this project of film, of conferences of smash were organised and a society of production candles when of real offices.
the details of the the the the operation to long secret, the film being based on the memories of tony mendez.
the film of the the the affleck is a combination wynn of several gender.
it if the the the is of the the the a on of the the the a thriller policy designed of way realistic but also a the& the caper movie the& the, the story of the the the a coup succeeded, of the the the a traîtrise- as, by example, in the trilogie ocean the the the if eleven, twelve and thirteen.
the ambiances. one: of sequences of tehran of lifestyle from( in the sequences sous-titrées are these of photographs iconiques of the the the the time of events and the way which, thanks to these pictures, these same situations have been rübig in the film, it not the the the there has not of large differences),
of passages more on-board of the the the hollywood, treaties with ironic and a little of the the the exaggeration,
and then of scenes the headquarters general of the cia and of the the the other institutions with of men costumés noted of the situation around of tables of conference, in the corridors and the telephone ...
ben affleck has succeeded to reinitiate its career of way remarkable.
of the the the player rejected, it is become a 77-year-old in stage respected and its game of the the the player has continued of to of remarks ironiques.
argo is its third long-métrage after the dark police the& the gone baby gone the& the( 2007) and the thriller the& the; town the& the( 2010).
it the the the is also the first film of the the the affleck which not. place not in its city of the the the origin, emerged.
the sense of the the the the atmosphere of the the the a place is the the the the a of characteristics which placèrent its first films above of rules hollywoodiens.
affleck fact also evidence of this sense of the the the the atmosphere in argo where the role of tehran the& the is held the& the by the canada.
the best scenes the film. a in of streets, at of the reconstruction of facts real the the sequence initial of the fall of the the the the embassy is impressive by its clarity which suggest also the confusion and the the the the unpredictability backdraughts when suddenly, in a place given, if the the the writing a page of the the the history.
affleck and its colleagues which a indeed and in the scenes fictives( the wrong team of filmed in the bazaar of tehran).
too of the the the actions to too of the the the places
the 77-year-old in stage has had. simply of the the the a about not the the the respecting in fact that little of scenes palpitantes, the sense there the term.
it if the the the in fate very,, it rajoute sometimes some elements to the reality and that, the result not the the the is not always also splendid( the stage in which the threat of crisis to the the the the airport of tehran is keep by a coup of telephone in america and the should on the runway of the the the aircraft are enough drawn by the and).
the weakness of the the the argo lies in its nature mirage, had to the need of show too of the the the events to too of the the the places different.
if the the the it is true that the the the alan arkin and john goodman are all to fact charmants in their role of coopérateurs hollywoodiens, their characters would emphasis a place more great and this not are not, far of that, the only in this case.
the film of the the the affleck lack a little of tension dramatic, it. leaves see with a interest portrayed, in manners the being and the lifestyle rétro of years 70.
it leads the observer, but with difficulty.
in as that order of the the the a history still, of the the the a some way, unfinished to this day, and as this the nature was of the representation of services secret as as and omniscients, it fact the the the the case.
of rules for resisted of balloons, the bananas and the circus
the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which leads every year a investigation public on the costs bank the more madness, has decided, to now, of to the competition the regulation or of ideas in from of the& the the the the the workshop eu the& the the more madness.
the& the the fact that the the the the eu considering, these time the, of the the the adopt a quota of 40 ninety of women for the direction of large companies european has been to the the the the origin of our decision the& the, has said for the newspaper právo the the the the reserved of this investigation, patrik nacher.
among the absurdities mentioned, it there has already, by example, the decision recent of the court european of the the the unify the premiums of the the the insurance for the men and the women.
until the the the to now yet, the women were avantagées for this which is of tariff of insurance on the life because that the the the they account, objectively, a any risk for the companies of the the the insurance.
the people can point until the the the to the end of the the the the year all another idea also incredible of the& the the the the the workshop of the the the the eu the& the.
the& the the vote will place before the end the months of february 2013 the& the, has informed nacher.
among the regulations controversial of the the the the eu. is, by example, the the the the obligation of the the the add of within surprisingly to fuel, this which has of consequences detrimental for the the the the environment, or the the the the ban of the the the use the reliable thermometers to mercury, only because that the the the they contain a amount relatively low of the the the a substance dangerous or still the directive on the size of cages of for, this which has resulted the the the the increase the price of eggs.
of criticism have also been from by the past to the the the the against of the the the the ban of fact of the the the use the the the the expression the& the butter to tartiner the& the or the from of the sale of energy-efficiency typical.
the bananas of quality must have a size of 14 centimetres.
the the the the administration european reacting often under the pressure of the the the a lobby commercial or industrial which the applications are usually advocated to brussels by a state or a group of the the the states( and the republic czech we currently the applications of its banks in threatening of the the the use its right of veto).
the interests of groups of pressure are also, by example, to the the the the origin the fact that in the the the the union, the bananas not must not be of the the the a size which to 14 cm or present a the& the contraceptives abnormal the& the.
the commission european if the the the is defended in motivating that the the the it not was that the the the evade of standards national not homogeneous which grounds the trade.
the standards on the fruit and vegetables have been relaxation despite the the the the opposition of some states, argument that the directives existing cause a waste of foodstuffs food.
the first price will can be prize in this investigation the regulation of the the the the eu of the the the the year last according which must case-bycase on the balloons realising a warning apos that the children of less of 8 years not must not resisted without surveillance of the the the adults.
the the the the eu has fact reference to a investigation american according which the balloons are, among the toys, the first because of death of the the the children by folly.
a restriction similar if the the the applies to children of less of 14 years for this which is of hot in of trompettes of burma.
home we also, we has of ideas confusing.
the rule following on the officials european themselves is enough absurd: in reason of the sensitivity of this issue for the greece, any person with a office official the in of the the the the eu not can use the name the& the macedonia the& the and must, to the place, about of fyrom( people macedonia macedonia of macedonia).
in cooperation with the the the the association the& the let do the& the which of economists liberals, the server bankovnípoplatky.com has appointed in this investigation, furthermore some absurdities mentioned above, the regulation of the the the the union on the volume of reserves of products food on the territory of republic czech.
the the the the eu had set of amounts maximum for the reserves of products food could. find on the territory of the republic czech the day of our accession to the the the the eu.
the republic czech dépassa then, by example, the amounts from for the- in retired and risqua, of this fact, a heavy fine.
the organisers of this investigation have was interesting the the the the idea of pay of are of the the the money to some countries because that the the the they not the the the have not of the the the access to the sea and the the the the idea of the the the granted a subsidies for ask the the the the done of subsidies.
these ideas not are however not from of brussels but of prague.
the& the the fact of not not have of sea we endangers.
we will ask to the the the the union european a private the& the. and if the the the is expressed, to the the the the autumn 2004, the minister of the the the the agriculture of the the the the time jaroslav palas( čssd).
it arguait that, the fact of our production of wheat, and following to shopping so-called the& the interventionist the& the, the the the the state if the the the was found with of stocks full that the the the it had had then exporting.
according palas, the the the the eu have had we pay of million of the the the eur, because that the republic czech. is far of ports.
in end of account, the commission european répondit positively to the request czech and organisa a appeal of the the the tender for the the the the purchase of wheat in from of countries without access maritime.
the subsidies for the the the the obtain of subsidies have been proposed to joint by the ministry the development local criticisms by the minister pavel němec( us-deu), these had, what, serve to proceeded of applications of subsidies times by brussels.
the the the the eu says: the& the the regulations confusing are few the& the.
if the regulations which often of criticism in the states member, according of many experts, the efforts deployed by the the the the had in on of regulation and of the the the improvement of the the the the effectiveness the functioning of the the the the union and that in the area of its development general, deserve rather of praise.
more serious is, by example, according the experts, the problem of the the the the use of subsidies of the the the the eu for of projects which not the the the have absolutely nothing to see with the strengthening of the the the the integration european, but which have been imposed by the states member at of negotiations budgetary.
the fact that the republic czech any, as of the the the other countries of the the the the union,. fight to brussels for the right of the the the use of banknote specific for these products traditional( fight which it not fate not always victor) does of strong emotions home the czechs.
if the term of six years of battle against the germans and the austrians, the czechs have defended with success the would the& the olomoucké tvarůžky the& the, for this which of the the the the from the& the tuzemský rum the& the which back home we the 19th century, our producers have had the replace by the would the& the tuzemák the& the.
only the products to basis of the the the alcohol of sugar of cane, and not not to basis of sugar of beet, can be the would of rum.
in the list official of products in of the the the the eu, we is today the the the today in company of cheese ucits known as the s or the gorgonzola, the massepain of james or the parma of parma, the biscuits of karlovy aforementioned( the& the karlovarské suchary the& the), the carpes of pohořelice and of třeboň( the& the pohořelický has třeboňský kapr the& the) and the hops of žatec( the& the žatecký chmel the& the).
the bread of the the the épice of pardubice( the& the pardubický perník the& the) and the gâteaux be the& the cornets of hořice the& the( the& the hořické trubičky the& the) can also be proud of their mark community.
the people want that i saves the republic, but i not am that the the the a systematic,. says senator okamura
mr the senator, how a the the the the idea of. present to elections presidential?
this not the the the is not of the the the be senator or president which account for me.
if all invisible without problems in our countries, i not would candidate nowhere on.
but i not longer more of see as the countries is plundered since these 20 last years, that the hunting not are not under the locks and the taxes and the the the the age the starting to the retirement increase.
i not the the the had not the the the the ambition of become papers.
but when i see something thing which not i mep not, then i to of the the the to a solution for that it exchange.
and as i the the the i more of forty years and that i am independent, member of the the the no party, i not the the the i not of the the the other solutions for influence the situation that of i present to elections presidential or place.
you are entered the senate but you you are set quickly in road for the castle( n.d.t.: seat of the presidency).
what that you not harassment not and the backs to those which you have elected?
i the the the i always said that i i reassessment in the battle for the castle according the results of elections place
by the following, i the the the i clear that if i the the the was elected senator, i i complain to elections presidential.
my aim not the the the is not the office, this not the the the is that the the the a instrument i will of to my vision.
it the the the is why i the the the i need of the the the the influence the more great and the mandate the more broad.
the problem not the the the is not only that the the the in as that nation we râlons the bar or before our post of television, but it the the the is also that we stalling with those which trying of the the the to the change.
to this if the the the add the press which scrapped the reputation of people and be freedom of floor with freedom of lying.
we has, by example, said to my about that i soudoie the journalists or that i the the the i been the advisor of paroubek jiří.
let to your visions.
you have started the fight for the castle with as priority of battle the subjects of the responsibility material and criminal of politicians and of statements tax rétroactives beyond of 20 million the# 91 the of czk the## the.
you must to this end change the law.
in as that president, you not have not of the the the a such power and only the senate in its together can propose of laws.
how you solve this problem?
when the the the in as that citizen, i the the the i fact pressure for that the activities of guide tourism are a profession liberal, i the the the i did won of because.
the problem it the the the is the politicaillerie: when someone the the the a sometimes of left or of right with a good project, it is been refused and it delays the citizens.
as independent, member of the the the no party, i the the the i many more of chance of the the the to the support of all the parties parliamentary.
i the the the i the the the the advantage of power, without catégorisation and dogma supporters, take of every party this that the the the it there has of best for our countries and the to in application.
you you reigns rather as a human of right or of left?
of the the the a point of view czech, i the the the i the the the the impression that the people i placed rather to left.
for me, that this be a little to left or to right, this not the the the is not really important.
for me, the the the the important it the the the is that we prerequisites of the the the the before.
this which account for me, this not the the the is not that the people are of left or of right but of together the people.
i support always any solution contributing the, common, even if it is proposed by the party communist or ods and i the the the done all also impartialement to the the the the against of have ideas.
what that you enragez when someone the the the a said of you that you are a populist?
but this that you have said not the prouve-t-il not?
when you sound a business plan in a company, you have also a some aim optimum and a vision.
you try of you in closer.
some can call it the populism, but all the proposals which i about have been applied by the world and of experts recognised in have about.
but without the support the parliament, it not you still that of slogans.
you not survivrez not long in policy with this.
you that if you will see the people and their about, you successful, by example, to impose the responsibility material and criminal?
i not the the the i not of the the the another option.
it i must convince the politicians, the journalists and the the the the opinion public and try of the by to my camp order of the the the the impose.
if i the the the was elected president, this not would not a problem of transmit in direct to the television my request to presidents of parties parliamentary of legislate on the responsibility material and criminal of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
they should then possibly explain why they not the the the in want not.
when the the the it there will a personality strong which will the abuse, it will possible of do pressure on the stage policy.
take by example the the the the election the president the suffrage direct, it has been achieved thanks to the pressure of the the the the opinion public.
i the the the confess, without uncertain, be a systematic, and not a you or a intellectual.
i the the the trying of find of allies for my views and my visions.
i from of i to in policy and i to of the the the to the support of the majority for my programme.
i the the the trying, only, of do forward the things, and if it not that not, i the the the end in six years and i had in the sector private.
it the the the is a little as if okamura to save the republic czech.
i not am not a architect.
i know that the the the a only person not can not do the difference, it the the the is why i am have see a number of people for their ask of. present also to elections place.
i the the the i met radim jančura, but it has refused in reason of the amount of work.
i the the the i the less supported the journalist of the the the investigation jana lorencová which has s the fraud the heating.
i i am presented because that the people are really dissatisfied but now i the the the hesitate.
sixty for% of people not the the the have not voted and this which the the the the have fact have, for the most, given their votes to a representative of the the the the establishment.
the senate, we not are that two independent.
the people have elected a senate which will other impose of changes.
despite all, i fight for my vision, by example the the the the election the suffrage direct of mayors and of french-style of regions.
you of quot your own party?
not, not still, because that i not the the the i not the time of check if the past of every member potential is without spread and then i not the the the in i not the means financial.
i not the the the i not not more of the the the money for my campaign presidential, i not the the the i that 20 thousand on my account the& the transparent the& the.
you not the the the have not of the the the money?
you about of statements tax, what is the yours?
i the the the estimated to about 60 million the value of my goods personal.
i the the the i to prague a ground of the the the a value of 25 million, a block of the the the a value of ten million, a another block valant 8 million, a where of the the the works of the the the art of the the the a value of the the the about ten million, a aston martin which applies 3.5 million and a skoda superb of the the the a value of 1 million and few million on my account.
be said in incidentally, i has a aston martin, because that it the the the was a dream of quot: i the the the i always been james step, which roulait in car, was galant with the women and.; against the it and the abuse.
you unlucky in aston martin, you have a heritage of the the the a value of 60 million and you not the the the have not of the the the money for your campaign?
you want change the republic but you not want not there invest your own money?
this not the the the is not very convincing.
i not the the the i not 15 million for this campaign.
i would i the the the endetter?
i the the the i already invested 2 million and half in the campaign.
the fact that i not the the the i no sponsor shows, that my programme not does not a great interest.
i not the the the i not the the the the obligation of pay this campaign of my pocket.
my costs of campaign are overall covered by the from that i receive in as that senator.
but i not would not in live, by example pay the the the the school english of my son which costs 30 thousand by months.
if my only objective was of win of the the the the money, i not i will to no election.
you will therefore continue your activities trade for power live?
not the the the had not said that you consultative your activities in anti-crisis?
but this not the the the is not linked the amount of this from.
as i the the the the i promised, i the the the i, reduced my activities.
by example, my deputy will the spring the direction of the the the the agency of travel.
the people would that i am a samaritain which saves the republic.
it must yet, that i live of something thing.
what was your wage monthly as when you were entrepreneur?
i gagnais and i still of win between two% and four% thousand.
if i the the the was president, i highlight end to my activities trade.
you will this interview in the the the the edition of saturday the newspaper práva.

,, a get you carrying the heart the mass, but the real concerned of the reading and of the the the the architecture if the the the open to you when you foulez the soil the building to the discovery of its topographie.
the the the the internal fully fact of glass is brighter and clear, the soil in using hollandaises and the galván élégants speak without clear the language of satisfied public municipal.
the the the the atmosphere urban is perfect.
we looking already the scrutiny of quarters public, of dogs and of small boys and small girls which play to the ball.
and everywhere of books, of books and still of books.
the& the normally, the shelves of library. are the long-term of the using and the middle. is a room great and dark, which is often breathing and reply the& the, explains willy maas.
we have completely upset the practice space classic and open the space of reading of the the the the internal to the the the the outside.
the the the the internal of the mountain of books has been adroitement aménagé: the middle. are the offices, the library internet, the club of the the the our, the centre for the the the the environment and the central technical the building.
a beauty particular lies in the shelves black of the library, which are from of lambris, from of balustrades, from of ramps of the the the toss.
a new experience for the view, the affect and the the the the odorat.
even the architects and the engineers the building endurcis not want not of materials unknown.
the& the we wanted work with of materials fond the& the, explains joop trouborst, head the project with of the common of spijkenisse, in a answer the standard.
it the the the is and that the the the a day we have found in a company agricultural frisonne a suddenly ad ad from of the the the the agriculture.
to netherlands, we use since of years of the voltage intensity of the the the a millimetre of the the the thick as substrat in the greenhouses and the fields.
it the the the is good market and the the the the we is the time.
the with voltage is used for a or two ifremer, then we can the throwing.
for the library, the voltage has been compressée, for the first time in of such quantities, in sheets of the the the a thick of four centimetres.
under the the the the indeed of the heat and of the pressure, the the& the landbouwplastic the& the( kpl) exchange of colour and. become in a material dark, consistent and rebuilding, which the the the the smell mentions to the time a car new and of shoes of sport.
in high of 105 marches. is the summit of the mountain.
the end of almost 500 metres, the coffee literature we offer a view imprenable on the city, but also of croquet hollandaises and of ficus in borne.
these the create a atmosphere, but they contribute especially the maintenance the level ideal of the the the moisture of the the the the air of the mountain literature.
of donations for the the the the same new
the& the it the the the is incredible, but despite all the land of glass, this building is a project model in on of the the the lannoye the& the, turkmen trouborst.

stefan spermon, the the the the informaticien septique aforementioned, if the the the is already risky to enter in the new library.
lisette verhaig also was already that.
cynthia bogarde, professeure of medicine traditional chinese, describes even the boekenberg as the& the the the the the same finally dignity. the& the of spijkenisse.
it there has few weeks in indeed, at of the the the the opening, every citizen has been invited to do from of the the the a paper from of its library personal.

szabo: the& the the germans must play a more great role. the& the
the the the the germany has chosen the the the the abstained at the vote on the the the the admission of the the the the state palestinian.
according stephen szabo, expert of relations between the united and the the the the eu, this decision the berlin in a situation policy delicate.
deutsche welle: the beginning of the week, the the the the germany had announced its intend of vote against the request of palestinians of the the the to the status of the the the state observer with of nations united.
but it has then chosen the the the the abstained.
why?
stephen szabo: the the the the germany not the the the agree not this that the israelis have fact to gaza.
however, berlin must do evidence of careful, because it has of relations particular with israel.
but i think also that the the the it not support not not more the position american.
the the the the germany he say its independence, without however. show too criticism towards israel.
at of the the the the us-led in libya of march 2011, the the the the germany had also chosen the the the the abstained at the vote on the implementation in place of the the the a area of the the the exclusion no-fly.
finally, the the the the nato imposa this able.
the the the the germany éprouve-t-elle of difficulties to adopt a position clear to about of large questions international?
the answer is yes.
the reason in is that berlin is in is of review its policy external, trying to if the the the from of the the the a policy for and say expressed by the americans and to create a policy external german.
of more, the lack of policy coherent and common the in of the the the the union makes the situation.
the germans. also therefore to several fronts.
we waiting of the the the them that the the the they play a role more independent, but they not the the the there are not used.
i believe that the the the they tâtonnent still for find this role, but are on the way of the the the a policy foreign the& the more normal the& the.
a policy external, as in france or in britain
that means then what the term of policy foreign the& the normal the& the for the germans?
it shows the will of the the the adopt of positions independent of those of united and of partners european, there including in this which concerns the are national.
i believe that the policy foreign german is also determined by its policy economic, therefore by the exports and its relations with some regions, as the russia, the china or the middle.
the interests economic germans are, in a some able, different of those of other large powers: it the the the is why the the the the germany must protect its interests.
these interests economic have affect the position of the the the the germany towards the conflict the middle and the the the the abstained at the vote of nations united?
the the the the germany has of the the the first of the the the important usually the middle, especially in the countries the gulf.
it the the the is why berlin must take warned to not not now the the the the opinion public, but also the by of countries arab.
it if the the the is that without no doubt of the the the a part key.
however, i not the the the there accorderais not too of the the the importance, because it not if the the the is not of relationship exclusively unilateral.
but it the the the is that in all case a part key in the thoughts strategic german.
the the the the germany reducing to its relations with the united in choosing the the the the abstained at of votes important, as in the case of the palestine?
i think that the european and the americans understand perfectly the position german.
it the the the is why i think that the from not the the the is not if serious that the the the it the the the the was in the case of the question libyan.
perhaps even that the the the the germany not the the the in will that more respected.
in indeed, the the the the germany has and demonstrated that the the the it must be taken the seriously in as that the the the player international and that its interests must be taken in account.
in europe, the views on the the the the initiative palestinian are various.
by against, the united have announced their veto of the the the a votes clear.
the views diffèrent-elles between the united and the majority of countries european?
it there has always had of differences to because of the stage policy domestic american.
i believe that the the the the administration obama fact secretly evidence of the the the a great understanding towards the position european.
but seen the practice policy the countries, the government not can, course not defend its position publicly.
i believe that the real differences of the the the views not are not if large that the the the they the moving always.
if you at the relations between obama and the first minister israeli netanyahu, you will that the the the obama is far of déborder of the the the enthusiasm to the the the the we of the policy of netanyahu.
the the the the germany éprouve-t-elle of difficulties to balance its relations close with israel and the united, of the the the a on, with the position of large partners european, of the the the another on?
i think that it not easier not the things for the germans.
course, this would a little more simple for the germans if the the the it there a policy european coherent and uniform, but today the the the today, this not the the the is not the case.
they not can therefore not if the the the these the in of the the the a line policy more and and must say their position strange.
it the the the is this that the the the they are currently in the question of the the the the euro.
to my opinion, the the the the germany contributor to the the the the future a role of take and push the the the the europe to adopt a position european.
this not the the the is not simple for the the the the germany, particularly to because of relations with israel.
this question has always been delicate.
but according me, the germans are, aware the fact that the the the they must play a role which mark more their independence.
the the the the germany. technical play a role of the the the player of weight on the stage international, the the the the germany does only ourselves a role key?
or, has always of difficulties to ourselves of roles of first plan?
the the the the germany not the the the there is always not habituée, this him is always breathing and, for of reasons obvious, the countries have always of difficulties to play a role more important.
if the the the the we at, by example, the crisis of the the the the euro, we remark that the the the to every time that the the the the germany decided of us more, of many have antiallemands. are hear.
it not easier not the things for the germans.
in fact, it the the the is always the even problem: we not wants not be encerclé of countries hostile.
of this point view, the the the the germany is in a position, more delicate that the united.
it must deal with of neighbours and of views very a, and this not the the the is not easy.
today the the the today, the the the the influence of united on the policy european not fact that reducing, but in this at, the the the the eu not gap not this empty, then which what?
the germans will simply play a role more important.
and even if it not their please not, even if it their is unpleasant and if the the the they not the the the in are that less appreciated, it the the the is the life!

the& the protection of brands the& the in china: when puma and as increasingly suddenly chinese
as and continuation ralph lauren are of brands known to through the world.
as continuation ... of what if the the the is really?
behind this name. behind a mark plea officially in china, but which not the the the has nothing to see with the the the the company original.
the mark this and of the the the a protection such that the the the the company which in is the name not can be complaint.
and even if it the could, it not the the the is not course that the the the it obtiendrait won of because.
the& the it is of more in more difficult for the foreign of protect their brands in china the& the, explains thomas pattloch, lawyer the cabinet charles wessing tourism-related in violation the right of property in east.
every week, a new dossier sometimes on my office.
the imitateurs not the the the have need that of few letters additional for power been their brands.
and, the place of gucci, we at lu-gucci, and the place of prada, we at prada-kny.
of companies german. are also burger in any legality, as puma, the manufacturer of the the the articles of sport.
pattloch other a files in which. are the recordings out with of the the the the office of brands of beijing.
the 14 september 2010, a company chinese has tabled the mark zegna df puma, a would that the firm has artificially created in if the the the availing a part the name of the the the ermenegildo zegna, the house of fashion.
it the the the is a fact known that the chinese are become the champions the world of the copying and of the violation of the property intellectual.
in the large cities, we is of centres commercial to several two-tier which not boutiques almost that of goods.
the case of pattloch are however different: its entrust the responsibility of if the the the with the fact that the the the the office chinese of brands as officially to companies chinese the right of the the the use a would which is already protected in a another countries.
the chinese speak of the& the bang mingpai the& the, of mark parente.
the term is secondary of the& the bang dakuan the& the.
it the the the is with this term that are designated the women which. pre-nuptial to of men rich.
the authorities chinese say not the the the have nothing to. reproach.
the& the it the the the is bad for the affairs, it must combat against this trend the& the, requires pattloch.
the& the the mark is neoliberal, the character is, the damage for the reputation are huge. the& the
the losses financial and the costs of justice. billions in million for the sectors concerned, especially in this which concerns the products flagship expensive.
according the data of the society of the the the analysis the market clsa, the china represents, with a volume annual of 15 billion of the the the eur, the third market world of products of luxury and that which. growing the more quickly.
however, it not the the the is not easy of radier the recordings very the register of brands and these procedures it expensive.
these last can last until the the the to nine years, and the the the the out not the the the is never some.
pattloch fact state of trial at fought the court has rejected the complaint, because after a long period, the would criticised was become a the& the reality the market the& the.
pattloch we explains that if the plaintiff not the the the has not of chance, it can even be obliged of pay of the the the the money the plagiaire, because it have undermined to its mark in china.
in this area, it the the the is sometimes the law of the jungle which an.
of case being concern also of elements charts.
in 2009, daimler had lost a battle legal against the manufacturer of machine of also sany, the even company which from of cheap the producer of dispensing to concrete putzmeister.
it the the the is the reason for which the chinese can use a dominant which like to the the the the star mercedes.
geely, the the the the acquisiteur of volvo, conditioning before a logo blue and white which us that of bmw. the conflict was been and geely dut the change.
the house of fashion lacoste had lost against the plagiaires of kong kong and of singapore which had réorienté the scrutiny the famous crocodile in the direction opposite.
according the authorities chinese, they not are guilty of nothing.
the the the the office of brands ctmo to beijing valid however have known few difficulties in 2010 to because of the the the a lack of staff and of the the the space.
however, the the the the office would past the the the the year last of the the the a the& the situation of the the the emergency in the about the work to a normality dignity. the& the.
and, the number of procedures of the the the opposition not treated have fallen of 22%.
almost of 57,000 case of this type would been closed, this which represents a increase of 75% by report to the the the the year previous.
however, 81,500 procedures are in suffering to the the the the office.
act costs expensive
as often in china, the figures are impressive.
the the the the year past, the ctmo has received more of 1.4 million of applications of tabling of mark, almost a third of more that the the the in 2010.
according the the the the office, it if the the the is of the the the a record and this means that the china. is for the tenth time can in head the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
this testing also for the number total of brands legal, which is of 5.5 million.
in 2011, the the the the office have counted 1.8 billion of yuan of right of the the the fees.
in of the the the other terms, every registration has reported in average 1,280 yuan, or 160 eur.
a battle legal costs, more, as the the the the illustrates the case of the the the the company family german freudenberg.
since more of seven years, the the the the company. fighting against a plagiaire chinese.
,, the germans have could to that the manufacture illegal of out of vehicle be suspended.
however, the the the the imitateur has could keep its rights chinese on the mark freudenberg.
the& the it the the the is our fault, because the names of family not can not be protected in germany the& the, explains hanno wentzler, president of the direction of freudenberg chemical specialities to munich.
the the the the office of brands had therefore rejected the the the the objection of munichites.
freudenberg has, did won of because with of two management will, but the part side still of. fight until the the the to today the the the today.
the vigilance is of implementation
today the the the today, the the the the case is in it with of the court supreme.
wentzler is gesture, it believes in a out positive the trial and virtues the amateurish of judges.
however, it add: the& the the procedure is long, trying and we costs many of time and of the the the money. the& the
it is also difficult of the the the assess the costs internal. the service of archives has even had to in them the acts of% last years order of the the the to of evidence.
it there has five years, freudenberg had even proposed in was to the part side a the& the biggest amount in eur to six figures the& the for to the dispute.
the& the it the the the is to this that the the the we has this that this represents for we the& the, turkmen wentzler.
the dangers of the the the the east threaten even of déborder until the the the in europe.
this would the case if of imitateurs of this region if the the the assuraient the the the the exploitation of brands not protected.
by example, a producer chinese he lay in germany the name of freudenberg for a company of production of chaussure and of leather.
the the the the company had since long abandoned this sector, but it had could when even prevent the tabling.
wentzler add: the& the the vigilance is of implementation the& the.
pattloch and him conseillent to companies german of do evidence of the the the a great careful in their relations trade with the china.
it not enough not, according them, of. proud the right international of brands, the foreign should rather the& the been also in china all this which is can of the the the be protected the& the, as the said wentzler.
otherwise, the costs can be, more important that those of the the the the registration.
in indeed, if freudenberg its the battle at the last act of its drama legal, the the the the company should pay of rights of licence to the part side for the the the the use of its own name, as the the the the explains wentzler.
or then, we lose our place on the segment the market in question.

facts to about of infections sexually communicable
what are the diseases sexually communicable the more is?
among the ist bacterial, we account the syphilis, the chlamydiées and the blennorragie( or gonorrhée).
the ist is are the hiv, the virus the schoolgirls human, the the the the herpès génital or the the the the hepatitis.
the hair the pubis and the gale belong to ist parasite.
what are the groups mainly concerned?
the syphilis and the blennorragie so often home the men which have of relations sexual with of the the the other men.
the the the the institute robert-koch estimated that the contacts sexual between men are to the the the the origin of the the the the less four case of syphilis on five infections in germany.
home the adults hétérosexuels, the infections linked to chlamydiées, the trichomonase, the candidose( fongique), the blennorragie and the virus the schoolgirls human are of diseases sexually communicable is.
the rate of spread the hiv between adults hétérosexuels is relatively low in germany. however, something 20% of new infections the hiv are observed the in of this group.
home the young, we is a rate of the the the infections linked to chlamydiées markedly more high that home the other groups of population.
of the the the after of reheated european, the three three-quarters of all the infections concern the young age of 15 to 25 years.
of more, in germany, the virus the schoolgirls human is aware home the young.
what is the the the the development the number of the the the infections?
it not the the the is not compulsory of say all the diseases sexually communicable.
according the the the the institute robert-koch, the number of case of syphilis has more that doubled in 10 years: the figure is past of 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
since 2007, the number of new infections the hiv is.

this represents a reduction of the the the a tenth by report to the the the the year previous.
what are the symptoms of the the the a disease sexual?
the diseases infectious can cause of drained the level of bodies mutilation, of pain urinaires, of losses with, of pain the bas-ventre and that the the the the appeared of boutons and of verrues.
however, they not the the the cause regularly no pain or another symptom and are therefore hidden.
how. protect?
the condoms can reducing the risk of the the the infection, but they not protect not to 100%.
the reason in is that the agents pathogens of diseases sexually communicable can also. to by infection lubrifiante or by of contacts body narrow.
the experts possesses therefore to any person changing often of partners sexual of to regularly of out.
the most of ist quickly dépistées can be have and the dashed always can be avoided.
thanks to parrainages, to donations, but especially to funds that reap the choristes thanks to their votes to through the the the the germany full, the means if the the the mounting.
the& the in all, we have already sent about 200,000 eur to esitjeni the& the, should annette lennartz, president of the the the the association.
the village, zodwa dlamini, a woman sure of course and which also always this that the the the it wants, combats the the the the money in from of the the the the germany.
it on also to this that the orphans are, boat, home a of their grandmothers by example.

in furthermore, the& the voices for africa the& the has created a school of designer and allowed the construction of two poulaillers. with the competition of the the the the organisation american for the health psi, the the the the association has organised a test of screening the hiv for of many inhabitants.
this not will not of course, because even if the disease is, visible in all the countries, it still a about taboo.
a king and its 14 wives
the& the the aids is a real taboo the& the, explains annette lennartz, the& the because it the the the is a about which affects the dimension. the& the
it the the the is enough curious, from of the the the a countries which the king has 14 wives official.
the last monarque absolute of the the the the africa black, the king mswati also, is known for its lifestyle of life excessive.
the polygamy to the place of the democracy.
these mœurs removed by the the the the state, between other, are responsible of the spread rapid the hiv seen these last decades.
the workers migrants have also scattered the virus to through the countries.
we is yet of condoms to every has of street, add annette lennartz, the& the but almost person not the use.
the culture is different, all against all. the& the
order of european something little the the the the exchange cultural, the choristes of the the the imbongi been together in travel all the two or three years in the south of the the the the africa and entonnent of ’ emplis of nostalgia, of courage, of confidence and of the the the identity black that number of the the the inhabitants of the state-of-the-art the continent black are still the time of the the the the apartheid.

the bus the believed always to esitjeni, where the choristes move visit to their godchildren.
even if the the the it is difficult of find the small village on a card, esitjeni is, known in the valley of the the the the ezulweni.
the& the will to esitjeni, you there will of the light the& the, say the people there.

however, person not fact of link between the discovery of the the the water and the the the the hypothesis of the the the a presence of life on the planet, explains the scientific in head of the probe messenger, sean solomon.
the temperature on mercury can reach 426 degrees celsius.
the discovery could help to understand how the the the the water and of the the the other elements essential to the life are arrived in of the the the other regions the system solar.
inaperçus of inhabitants of our planet, of sondes, of trips and of small robots as adventures such the depths of the the the the universe.
of time to another, they sending of images to the earth, such of small interstices to through which we is the the the the infinitely.
the the the the image from of the the the a equipment photographique developed by of researchers germans of the the the the institute max-planck.
the eight milky of our system solar, and that the planet naine cérès.
as pluton, which orbit around the sun behind neptune, cérès not the the the is not considered as a the& the planet the& the, according the new definition the term of the the the the union as international of 2006.
this detail of the the the a photograph infrarouge taken by the unanimous spitzer shows a the& the khaled of family the& the of flood generations of the the the stars: the more; stars are in blue and the points roses, more difficult to identify, are the the& the newborn the& the in the room of the the the delivery of the the the the universe.
the unanimous spitzer has discovered this region where produce the stars, dubbed the& the w5 the& the, a name, little romantic, in the constellation of cassiopée, to 6,500 from.
the unanimous spitzer of the nasa has atomic the the the the underpin flamboyant of the the the a star in is of die.
the circle in form of beignet is up of the the the elements that the the the the star projette when it dies.
in the the the the huge reduced trifide, to 5,400 from of the earth, the gas and the dust make of new stars.
the unanimous spitzer has atomic this room of the the the delivery galactique.
the pléiades, rubbish of the the the stars also called the& the the seven nuns the& the, can be observed to the the the the naked soul for the night.
however, the unanimous the more the colours in value.
on this photo infrarouge, the reduced of the the the hélice, as a naked red, at directly the observer.
it. is to 700 from in the constellation the verseau.
its similarities with a continent earthly him have effort the as of the the the america the north.
the combination of the photo normal and of the photo infrarouge can of the the the observe a georg spectacular.
only the detectors radar the unanimous spitzer have could rated a image of the new star in any its beauty.
a of more large énigmes of the the the the astronomy is on the creation of rings of rings.
a theory is that the rings are the leftovers of the the the a moon of rings which has disappeared it there has 4.5 billion of the the the years without to of trace.
a of photographs the more large and the more net that the the the has taken the unanimous hubble is the of the voyager the tourbillon.
according the georg, the photographs of milky spirales can become of real works of the the the art.
the photograph published by the the the the centre southern european shows the reduced the trifide in the constellation the sagittaire, to several thousands of the the the from.
the name of trifide has the word latin the& the trifidus the& the( divided, shared in three), because three by of dust – the heart luisant the place of birth of stars.
the voyager have atomic the beginnings of the the the a carambolage cosmique in the constellation the serpentaire: to 400 million of the the the from of the earth, the noyaux of two milky in fusion. précipitent the the the the a to the the the the another, the severity is inevitable.
the unanimous hubble has observed the birth of these stars in the voyager spiral m83.
if you not the the the like not the abbreviations technical, you can use its quot of the& the mir of fire southern the& the.
the photo the unanimous space hubble shows a detail of the reduced of the the the the iris, in the constellation of céphée.
the reduced. is to 1,400 from and is composed of grain of dust which are ten to% time more small that the dust domestic common.
this photo has been developed to from of entrenched radiation and radiographiques taken by different trips.
we can there see the circle up of holes black which. is to ours million of the the the from of the earth.
the unanimous space has atomic for the nasa this group of milky as arp 273.
the scientists have appointed the more great voyager spiral the& the gc 1810 the& the.
in this reduced. is the group of the the the stars young the more brighter of our way milky.
the cradle heavenly gives always birth to of new stars.
these clouds of the the the stars, which are set by the reduced of the rosette, create also in permanently of young stars to 5,000 from of the earth.
in this voyager to shelves brighter and breakthrough of the the the a small hole black, it not the the the there not still of dust, it not the the the there has that the gas.
the scientists think that the the the it is born little after the bang, when the the the the universe was up in great part of the the the hydrogen.
our scrutiny on the the the the universe: the main trips
the unanimous have been invented in 1608 by – lipperhey, before that galilei not the the the the utilisât a year more later for observe the stars.
since, the energy-producing of trips radiation not the the the have not continued of top and thanks to them, it has been possible of see always more far in the the the the universe.
for 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the unanimous hale of the the the the centre the mont palomar almost of san in was the more great unanimous the world.
the mirror on this image had a diameter of five metres.
in the the the the arizona, to united,. is the broad binocular telescope.
it can of the the the observe the the the the universe to through two energy-producing with everyone a diameter of 8,4 metres.
the womb the gran telescopio canarias to the la, to islands canary, is huge. the mirror to him only reached a diameter of forecasts metres.
the mirror the southern african broad telescope in africa the south has been segmenté order of do of economies.
the diameter reached all of even about eleven metres.
the the the the disadvantage of the method of construction economic is that the unanimous is set the level of the the the the from plane, this which in limit the mobility.
the unanimous hobby-eberly the texas is him also set the level of the the the the from plane.
its unusual but to its great capacity of collection of light.
despite a diameter of mirror relatively small, this capacity. closer of those of more large trips to energy-producing the world.
the scientists listening the the the the universe to the research of signals extra-terrestres to the the the the aid the radiotélescope of the the the arecibo( puerto rico).
this radiotélescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
any person owner of the the the a computer can help to the the& the search for extraterrestrial intelligence the& the( seti, or the& the research of the the the the intelligence extra-terrestre the& the) in by to contribution the power of calculating of its machine.
view on the the the the centre european southern( institutes), in the andes that.
here. is the very broad telescope( the& the very great unanimous the& the), a installation way of its name.
thanks to a total of four energy-producing, this unanimous can for the spectre infrarouge way.
the construction of the the the a very great unanimous european( european extremely broad telescope) is also will for the website of the the the the institutes the chile.
its mirror main should reach the size impressive of 42 metres. it will up of almost of 1,000 elements of energy-producing.
however, the unanimous not will take of entrenched before 2018 the more early.
until the the the in 2007, the two trips of keck on the volcano hawaïen the mauna kea were considered as the more large the world.
they arboraient two energy-producing of the the the a diameter of 10 metres everyone.
the trips of keck are part of the the the the centre the mauna kea which is the sky with the unanimous subaru and the the the the irtf.
a new unanimous enormous should also be built on the mauna kea and the diameter of its mirror will 30 metres.
this this can of the the the the relax.
however, the images of the the the the space the more important we from the unanimous space hubble.
since the 24 april 1990, it we paper of images of worlds tangible.
since march 2009, the unanimous space kepler looking of exoplanètes, essentially those which are writings.
the nasa has announced the 2 february 2011 that the the the it had found 1,235 milky incumbents since the beginning of the mission.
this photo illustrates the the preparations before the launching the unanimous space kepler.
the unanimous space james-webb( jwst) will sent in the the the the space the more early in 2018 to on of the the the a rocket ariane 5.
the first mirror the unanimous space infrarouge has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
the unanimous will particularly for mission of find of the light icholson by the first stars and milky after the bang.
the scientists think that the pole south of mercury is also of the ice.
however, no data reliable on this theory not the the the there, because messenger orbit, more almost the pole north of mercury.
the data radars stakeholder since of decades the presence of ice on mercury.
thanks the launching of the probe messenger in 2004, the first to orbiter around of mercury, the scientists in have now the sure.

a investigation on a countries, in which we is still relatively young to 97 years.
the travel in the mountains talysh is of the the the a romantic échevelé.
the blunt of many- of the road, the small bus cahote the long-term of from maintain, of lakes torrentiels and of farms limited.
all is green and fertile, we. you almost in the forêt-noire.
but we we are here in the south sense of the the the the azerbaijan, the border with the the the the iran not the the the is that the the the to few kilometres.
it the the the is here that live the group ethnic caucasus the name of talysh, to about which we not knows not little, if this not the the the is that the the the they speak perfectly the persan and the the the the azeri and that the the the they have a very great longevity.
terminus: lerik.
the small city plastronne with its architecture too aggressive of the the the the time soviet which not if the the the over not the all with the landscape of mountain pittoresque.
the tourists european are few here, the informed since the capital of the the the the azerbaijan, baku, is, too practically.
it must eight hours for go the 323 kilometres, because the road not the the the has that the the the a only way.
the province not the the the has not still taken of the wealth archipelago that the countries must to its reserves of oil in the sea caspian.
however, pilata fatulayeva, 48 years, is convinced that lerik has the potential for become a place tourism.
the& the baku is become famous in may thanks the competition of the the the the eurovision, and the the the the year next, it there will here the festival of people the more; the world the& the, explains fatulayeva.
it is guideline the museum of the longevity, the only museum of the ensure the world.
we can there find the life of the the the about eight tens of talysh of the region which have more of 100 years. fatulayeva we shows a photo in black and white.
this my grandfather, it has reached the the the the age of 120 years.
have still a child to 136 years
but the star controversial the museum is şirali müslümov, a berger which have had 168 years.
it not the the the there however not of the the the act of birth.
and when we think that the more old person hospitality had 122 years, the the the the age of müslümov seems more that very.
the& the it is born in 1805 in this region, it is death in 1973 the& the, should fatulayeva.
the the the the human. would marié three time and it have had 23 children. to the the the the age of 136 years, it have still designed a daughter.
şirali müslümov. lose horribly of few decades in stressing its age?
rembrandt scholz, gérontologue to the the the the institute max-planck of heckling, him has also course about of the the the the human the great age of the the the asia central.
the& the of people étonnamment elderly live also in some regions of china, the japan or in the valley of hunza the pakistan the& the, explains scholz, the& the in sardinia also, it there has of men which live unbelievably old. the& the
however, it is impossible of the the the establish a evidence scientific in reason of the the the the lack of documents, without be that the the the it not the the the there had not of register of the the the state civil.
every day, a glass of butter equivalent
it is however of fact that the people of the region of lerik deliver often a age way of patriarches of the bible.
currently, 20 people have more of 100 years.
what is therefore the reason of the longevity in the south of this countries?
farid mugimzadeh, the guide tourism azeri, explains that the talysh have of genes individuals.
by against, fatulayeva, the guideline the museum, think that it the the the is a question of the the the food.
however, it not seems not insofar, of the the the a point of view regards, that the meal rich in calorie of talysh, which like the meat, the bread and especially the products milk and which many any from a glass of butter equivalent, are good for the health.
or, what the fashion of life simple which preserves the young of people? to cengemiran, a tiny village closest of the city of lerik, live rubaba mirzayeva.
with its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the region.
mirzayeva, which states have 104 descendants, live in a modest house of wood, as it is typical of the the the in see in any the region the caucasus.
it is with on the soil to on of the the the a baratte, which it fighting the content and.
eight people live here under a only roof, among which a of son of mirzayeva and a daughter, which are since long adults.
two small children gambadent also in the house.
in the kitchen, we preparing the tea for the from served in of glasses armadus unprofitable in form of womb.
the cows with of mirzayeva are perfectly modelled, and under its headscarf. there of long tresses of the the the a blond foncé that its son we as with pride.
i the the the i always bathwater my and with the milk, and it the the the is and that i not the i never lost and that the the the they have did their colour.
the& the i not the the the i never used of hair the& the, add mirzayeva.
the retirement increment enough for live
it has always forward this which from of its own firm: tomatoes, potatoes of earth and small pound.
of any my life, i not the the the i never bought the any pulp in a supermarket.
then, it we about of its husband which was in the the the the army.
the worst times have been after the second war world.
but all if the the the is improved when the the& the father beloved the& the predictably predictably a the orders.
the language of the propaganda surprised in the mouths of the the the a old she.
however, the religion of the one paternelle of the nation, a human which has yet criticisms its countries as a dictator, not translated almost not of limits in azerbaijan
it has been the power until the the the in 2003, its son ilham him succéda by the following.
what that the the the it in be, the people elderly of the the the azerbaijan not are not the distress.
mirzayeva receiving mensuellement 230 manats( about the even amount that the the the in eur) for its retirement, a amount which guarantees a good is of life in the region.
and perhaps that the son since long grisonnant of mirzayeva has reason: the& the the fetches been of the the the a great respect in our culture the& the.
they are the centre of the great family, they are popular, spending and happy.
is a good reason for live the more long possible.
the the& the rights of the the the the human the& the omitted in the constitution
the revolution resurrected the cairo.
of demonstrations fretilin contribution the from deep the countries.
the project of constitution based on the sharia is witness controversial.
the president egyptian not the the the is not field of words piedmont of the the the emotions.
we must success the transition.
the& the and this success is of my responsibility towards the people and towards god the& the, he said to the television of the the the state.
its speech was for the people all over, but also especially to christians christians, to liberals, muslim appliances and lay.
because all the member of the the the the opposition confused and desperately désunie have fear.
they have fear of the the the a secular on the nile to hands of powerful brotherhood muslim.
mohamed morsi has said, almost in if the the the finishing, have marketed quot the competences of the court constitutional and widened the responsibilities the& the order of save the revolution the& the.
however, the egyptians and the world not know not really this that wants save this engineer of 61 years, holder of the the the a doctorate of the the the the university american of california the south.
the power judiciary will overthrown?
the 234 articles served to the unorganised by the the the the house constituent stigmatised islamic of 100 people at of the the the a turn of force attending of 15 hours are indeed worrying in a some able.
as in of constitutions previous, the project plans that the judicial based on the& the the principles the right islamic the& the.
but that means really the word the& the principles the& the?
it the the the was and this still always a question of the the the interpretation, and it there has of good reasons of fear that the islamic using the wording wave and the for of manoeuvre legal which in that for apply a interpretation more stricter of the sharia.
in all case it the the the is that gives to think a article newly introduced organised that, in this which concerns all the issues relating to the sharia, the the the the university al-azhar must be falls. the the the the establishment is the the the the institution islamic the more important the countries and its underpin rayonne on all the world islamic moderate.
this can, but not wants not necessarily say that the clergy observing the the the the equipment legislative, this which would of de the implementation under supervision the power judiciary.
of many points the project of constitution are on to interpretation
a another aspect issue is the maintenance likely of the jurisdiction military.
for the is of mubarak, these courts if the the the employèrent to repress the opponents.
after the fall the dictator, until the the the to 11,000 civilians were prisoners by the military.
the the the the state must also, can read in the project, protect the& the the real nature of the family egyptian the& the and the& the promote its moral and its values the& the.
of the the the a point of view legal, the wording is if wave that the institutions of the the the the state could even control the content of the the the the art cinématographie and of the literature.
in clear, it if the the the would all simply of censure.
of more, no article not guarantees explicitly the the the the equality between the men and the women.
the place of it, a another article from of the the the- or of slandering the prophet prophet or its sent.
by against, the the the the article not defines not this that the the the is a offence or how it must be punished.
all also hiring is the wording by hear that the the the it is from of the the the the& the- the people the& the.
suffit-il of broken a caricature the president or of tell a joke the detriment of the the the a human of law?
of many points are therefore on to interpretation in the project that morsi surrendering the vote and which, according its own words, will the& the very soon the& the the the the the subject of the the the a referendum with of egyptians.

the rakfisk of norway: if the the the is the fish the more odorant the world?
the five million of people which about the norway have of the the the a of more their levels of life, not only in europe, but also in the world.
the secret of the success the countries possible be linked to the the the the apos of local for a fish extremely odorant?
take of cheese advanced.
placez-les the middle of the the the a testify of clothing of footballer mouillés and comment.
answers a week.
and you an the the the the smell alternative the rakfisk, the the the the a of wary the more value of norway.
i am in the small city of fagernes, to about 3 hours of the the the oslo.
it snow, the landscape is spectacular- and this smell, there, creates the the the the air.
the rakfisk. consists of truite saupoudrée of salt and fermentée in the the the the water for a period- according the the the the smell that you want that the the the it reeks- which can go until the the the to a year.
when the the the the dark if the the the progressing and that the the the it fact cold, the norwegians. are in mass for attend to a festival which has place here, to fagernes, devoted to this speciality flavour incredible.
the& the you mangez believed, then you avalez a glass of the the the outburst the& the, explains havard halvarsen, fire-fighter local to time full that the the the the we called also the& the rakfisk required the& the, responsible of the management the festival.
around of we, the people avalent of small several of fish and if the the the enfilent a great amount of drink.
the& the some people by the the the the outburst the rakfisk the& the, add havard.
the drink can the the the the smell.
i the the the tried few several.
if you can avoid of the do to under your would, this not the the the is not bad- this fact think to a menus which have past of long hours in a bus.
the rakfisk back to a time where the norway was poor, before the the the the invention of the permits, the fish was immergé in of barriques of the the the water étanches to the the the the air, then salé in autumn.
then, the in of the the the the winter, a time, fermented, the fish is out and- without no doubt with the sense amoindris by the the the the alcohol- forward.
to the generation previous, of thousands of norwegians have been forced of leave their countries for find the work, émigrant mainly to the united.
to now, the population. growing quickly- more of 13% are of immigrants, albeit by the full employment, the their wages and a system of health full.
the swedish, their old rivals which the countries was it not the the the there has not if long more rich that the norway, cross the border for come work.
the rakfisk is treated as something thing of the the the important, a part vital,, that the the the odorant, the past of the norway.
this fact party of dish the more gentlemen.
but all is expensive- a small pinte of beer or a sandwich you coûteront 10 € everyone.
the norway not fact not often about of the the the it in the news international, this which not the the the is not for him déplaire.
here, the people not are not prepared to about of the the the mushrooms breivik, the racist extremist of right which has this 77 people, among which of women and of children.
when the the the they apos this killing, they speak of the& the the the the the incident the 22 july the& the.
the norwegians have the it to accept that in their countries peaceful, the the the the a of their has could acting a such act of barbarity.
since the beginning of years 70, the norway must its wealth to its industry oil and faced, the the the the a of more important the world.

we are- how you- of people prudent.
its english, as that of the most of people which live here, is perfect.
we are discreet, we not the the the like not we do out.
the norway has managed its wealth oil with many of careful- all, to the the the the exception of the the the a low percentage of the the the money from of this industry, is invested in a funds special the profits of generations future.
when of the the the other countries foundation the the the the money by the drain, the in of years which we have led to the crisis financial international, the norway has as keep the purse of its stock, schedule.
the& the as that the the the the we can keen in winter and do of the motocross in been, we are happy the& the, should anna.
the& the without forget the rakfisk the& the, says in a laugh insouciant.
i i like standing under the snow and i am the queuing for i the the the buy of what eat- i the the the i had my water-based of rakfisk.

but this evening, the the the the smell the fish is everywhere.
the the the the hotel in which i visit is the the the the a of many places where the the the the we is the rakfisk for dinner and where the the the the we can vote for the best of the the the between them- or perhaps for the more odorant of the the the between them.
it there has a emission of tv where the recommended is a nœud-papillon, by of the the the unlabelled of rakfisk.

my crisis identity mexico-américaine
it said that many have been forced to leave the mexico to because the lack of the the the opportunities
the mexicans have trend to them those which are parties the they vividly to mexicans the periods difficult, he said.
navarrette said that the mexico-américains. are taken between two worlds.
at of the the the a recent travel to mexico, in drew in the hall, before the services of customs and of the the the immigration, i i am felt lost.
of panels stakeholder two paths: a for the the& the mexicanos the& the( the& the mexicans the& the), a another for the the& the extranjeros the& the( the& the foreign the& the).
i am left idle for several seconds, not knowing not to what by i should.
i the the the i grew in the centre of the california, where the the the the we i the the the has called the the& the mexican the& the any my life.
it if the the the is of the the the a hesitating ethnic, the even as that that that my friends of emerged using when the the the they. say the& the irish the& the, or my friends of new york when the the the they. say the& the italian the& the.
then, i am become the& the mexico-américain the& the.
but, here, it the the the was the mexico.
and, on the earth which has seen born my grandfather, there need of hesitating special or of part of the the the union.
i the the the was simply a american.
i about spanish, enough, for manage a maintenance in the the the the a or the the the the another language.
but i not the the the i not the vocabulary of the the the a indigenous, and i not can not lose my emphasis american.
then i the the the i taken my passport american and i i am criticisms to the by the& the foreign the& the.
i the the the i thought to this then of the week when the new president mexican chair pena nieto has visited visit the president obama, to the president.
generally, when the leaders of these two countries. meet, their subjects of favourite are the the the the immigration, the drugs and the trade.
pena nieto had also to of about of the growth of the the the the economy mexican, which is the the the the a of reasons which are the mexicans to remain the mexico rather that of. sake to united.
it wish if the the the with to united and the canada, and create a union for the trade on the model of the the the the union european, but in america the north.
and pena nieto if the the the commitment to continue the war against the barons of the drugs the mexico,, that the the the it not the the the has not provided more of details.
for the mexico, the relationship with the united is get and full of the the the bitter.
the most of americans not the the the have probably never will the fact that the the the in 1848, the united have invaded the mexico and forced its leaders to were by writing the half of their territory to the state-of-the-art the gun.
but for the mexicans, which stop in terms of centuries, and not of minutes, the memories are everywhere.
by therefore, as that the the the a official u.s. formula the any criticism to the the the the we the mexico, you start to hear 700.00 in the press mexican, and among the by 700.00 of complaints on the way which the americans been an to the sovereignty of their neighbouring.
and the children of montezuma seek the there.
and yet, for the mexico, the relationship the more difficult is the that the countries has with the more of 35 million of mexico-américains which live to united.
you want that the the the we area the about of the the the the bitter?
it there in has many.
the mexico has its winners and its losers, of people for which the countries offer of opportunities and of the the the other for which the countries not the the the in offer not.
the only reason which explains the great number of the the the ancêtres mexicans in of cities as los angeles, palmas vegas, adventures, denver or san antonio, is that the the the to a at given, in our trees généalogique, a person, perhaps a parent or a grand-parent, not the the the has found no opportunity the mexico and has had go in the north.
and the more often, this person corresponded to a profile type 700.00 a skin passports, little instruit, from of the the the a village poor, etc.
we are their descendants, and we are loyal towards them.
not the mexico.
and even if we live currently the dream american, that we are of in of good schools and that we have of good situations, we not must never lose of view that it the the the is the dream american that we live, and not that of mexicans.
our identity is sometimes emotion, but our loyalty is obvious.
we the the the the grant to united.
by,, we know that the the the a part of the the the the elite mexican among the class turkish not we like not.
the feel is reciprocal.
we their remember a defeat humiliating and they we alike as if we were of individuals of ethnic which and not enough mexican.
our spanish not will never enough good, our links with the mexico not will never enough strong.
for them, our existence is mean of the the the failure.
if our families not the the the had not failed when the the the they living the mexico, they not would never parties.
and we not we end not stuck the good on of the barrier, living ambiguous to united, but as of âmes lost.
my woman which is was to guadalajara and which has emigrated legally to united then that the the the it was child, i remember that the the the it there of friction between the mexicans and the mexico-américains, because the mexicans suppression more strongly their identity and the mexico-américains in are contrariés.
, that the the the it be on american, it has the feel of do part of two countries.
by,, of many mexico-américains that i know not the the the have not the the the the impression of do part of the the the a countries or of the the the the another.
we keen the music the group mexican, los banning del norte, but also the of bruce springsteen.
we have the best of two worlds, but we not are rooted in no of two.
the mexico, we we considers as of americans.
and to united, we we considers as of mexicans.
and now, for complicate a little more the relationship, as i the the the the i learned for my residence, some leaders mexicans and a part of the the the the intelligentsia want. closer of the diaspora.
they want that the mexico-américains work in as that the the the ambassadors of emergency for the mexico, in representative its interests to united.
we have explain to our fellow americans that the mexico is a countries magnificent that the the the it must absolutely visit and to the pressure to leaders political for strengthen the links with the mexico.
yes,, course.
this not the the the will not.
it there has too of the the the bitter.
and, if the the the the we considers the inequalities of wage, the corruption and the violence with to the drugs which are ubiquitous, many of the the the between we not are not believe that the the the it if the the the is of the the the a countries fantastic.
you will duty you deal only, amigos.
it the the the is normal.
if some mexicans not are not still prepared to forgive the united of the way which they have treaty the mexico it there has a century and half, they must by therefore accept that some mexico-américains their in astounded always of the way which the member of their family have been treaties it not the the the there has not if long.
hmmm.
perhaps we more the& the mexicans the& the that i not the thought.
;;, new east
the cease-fire between israel and the hamas is still a failure for the peace.
not deployment never there have a peace sustainable between the arab and the jews the east?
a another hope of blood seems must that the the the a such hope is was.
while that persist the same arguments trivial for know which has started, of tens of buildings have been reduced in dust the more of 140 palestinians, the most of the the the between them were of civilians, and six israelis have been killed the and, for the first time, of rockets drawn of gaza have video almost of aviv, the mainland of the the the israel, and the city holy of jerusalem.
but, that the israelis and the palestinians seem blocked in their former conflict, all around of the the the them, the east is in full changing.
the spring arab has all fact is in apart, and that the the the we the whether or not, the palestinians and the israelis are arena by this upheaval regional.
perhaps that their fight if the the the will still a little more.
yet, it there has all the reasons of think that this could the help to out of this even deadly.
a war which not fact no losing or no all
to first view, it seems difficult of do evidence of the the the optimism.
even if the cease-fire devoted the 21 november. is, the fighting of this week have commission the supporters of the force, of two sides.
the leaders the hamas, the movement an which is the gaza since 2007,. targueront of the the the have forced the israelis to should, even if gaza has hostility a raclée.
have killed some of its leaders and refoulé the 1.7 million of the the the inhabitants of gaza in the the the the a of to the more- and surpeuplés of the planet, israel not the the the has not succeeded to destroy the hamas.
in indeed, the hamas is the ground on the bank, the the the the another part of the palestine currently to hands of their rivals the fatah, the the the the another faction palestinian more restraint.
of more, the leaders the hamas could. say that the time is their ally.
the the the the influence of islamic the world arab is of more in more strong, and the hamas if the the the is fact of friends rich and powerful.
the turkey, a power regional in full rise, once the the the the ally muslim the more closest of the the the israel, has taken fact and because for the hamas the all as the qatar, the the the the a of states the more rich and the more dynamic the golf.
the member the hamas jubilent and say that the being an. we around of the the the israel, since the lebanon, in the north, where the militia the hizbollah take its under, in incidentally by the syria, where the rebels to trend an can reversal bashar el el-assads, and until the the the to the jordan, where the allies the hamas threaten the king.
and the more important, on the eastwards south of the the the israel, the far-right of brotherhood muslim under the presidency of muhammad morsi in egypt, of far the more populated and the more central of countries arab, has changed the the the the balance of the region.
hosni by, this with which has run the the the the egypt for 30 years until the the the to its fall in 2011, had little of time to spend the hamas.
in however, the brotherhood muslim are of cousins the hamas, and their leaders if the the the in they more easily to the the the the opinion public.
in the diplomacy future, the hamas can emerging in as that the the the player of the the the importance which not will more be excluded even by israel and the the the the america.
for this time, the supporters of the line hard of the the the israel will the conclusions opposite.
in terms military, the hamas has been, in box.
the system of the the the intercepting of missile as iron dome has proven its efficiency and of many missile the hamas have been destroyed.
the israelis will power sleep on their two night- for a some time.
in terms of diplomacy, the the the the america renouvelle its support full the and of many countries european have criticism the hamas of the the the be to the the the the origin of the last wave of violence.
but especially, israel has prospéré, particularly under binyamin netanyahu, the premier-ministre, which has completely ignored the process of peace.
, that the into of rockets of gaza have killed about 30 israelis since 2004, israel has been been by the attacks suicide, particularly thanks to the barrier of separation which into on the bank, the piece main of this which could be a state palestinian, and which protects the colonies jewish which still of if the the the expand despite their not in on of right international.
mr netanyahu, which the party likud has prosecurot with a party still more belliciste, that the leader avigdor lieberman to the the the the approach of the the the the election the 22 january, has the part a.
why dorloter these fichus palestinians in their giving a state?
if the the the they control the bank, not lanceraient-ils not of rockets, as their fellow the the the the have fact to gaza?
it is better of the keep behind this wall and of the hit as that the the the they outside the head.
perhaps that the supporters of the line hard the the the the us the but it. can that the spring arab exchange the gives.
even if the islamic which are the power in egypt and, rated little israel, their priority will of if the the the with to problems in their own countries.
the budget of the defence of the the the israel is more important that that of its four neighbours arab together.
start a war with the superpower local not the the the help not the new governments arab to convenient their economies.
mr morsi has worked with barack obama for to a cease-fire this which is of good well 700.00 and could everything the beginning of something thing.
the israelis should also think to the the the the future.
with the still the world arab which becoming more democratic, must the palestinians of their right to the the the the self-determination could create a powder which is will to skyrocket a day in the territories occupied by israel- a little as the bus which has exploded to aviv this week.
the repression weakened already the democracy in the the the the state jewish, and the demography brings this problem to able that the population arab is.
the missions bloody against gaza all the two or three years for clock the hamas will a price on the plan diplomatic.
the two sides have need of the the the be pushed by those of the the the the outside.
the answer still the outright by the people reasonable that the the the the we is of every on, and by the most the world outside and by this newspaper: two states, with a surrendering of territory by israel in exchange of the security.
a hope, small and to short term, is that the cease-fire will the the the the opportunity to people external of defend this because.
the the the the egypt, which must now if the the the mission to to end to the movement of the the the weapons to gaza, the even as that the turkey and the qatar, is better placed that never for persuading the hamas of the the the accept the the the the idea of the the the a state jewish with to borders of 1967 with of trade of ground and a jerusalem shared.
the arab of countries encouragement should also do pressure on the hamas and the fatah for that the the the they if the the the unites.
this would, more to the creation of the the the a state palestinian that the proposal next of the the the a pseudo state to the the the the un.
mr obama has also all interest to this that the the the israel accept of negotiate.
the in of its first mandate, it not the the the has not presented its own plan of peace.
of return to the president, it seems all also shied to in establish a.
it the the the is a vision very restricted.
the stability the east is a importance vital for the the the the america.
this is by a agreement of peace between israel and the palestinians.

i the the the i past five hours in a airport for the period of thanksgiving, because our air had of problems engine and we have had wait the the the the arrival of the the the a another air.
by therefore, i the the the i had enough of time for think the issue of the the the the for.
i not will not you lying.
to a participated in a airport for wait a flight is enough boring, even when you have of books, of magazines and of iphones for you distract( without forget the shops of duty-free).
but of more in more, some academics and experts specialist in the development of the the the the child are the the the the praised of the the the the for.
it is perfectly normal for we- and our children- of if the the the bore of time in time, they.
this force the brain to right of railways interesting, even of feed the creativity.
and as we are, for the most, constantly before several types of the the the screens, we not know more the benefits of the the the the for.
then should welcome the the the the for to arms open?
yes.
and not.
but i the the the there return.
all of the the the first, to the the the the like of many of people, i thought that the the the the for was a phenomenon rather recent, particularly since that we have more of time free.
but this not the the the is not the case, says peter toohey, professor of the the the history her to the the the the university of examining, the canada, and author of the& the boredom: has lively marches the& the( yale summer associated, 2011).
the& the the the the the for back to very far the& the, he.
on the walls of pompéi top-priority of abusing latins which apos the the the the for, they back the first century.
then, it there has the definition that we our to the the the the for.
the problem is that the the the it has been defined, and debated, of different ways, has said john d. eastwood, professor agrégé of psychologie to the york summer in the the the the ceta, canada.
after have come of many published and to the the the the idea to a group of debate of the the the about 100 people, the professor eastwood and its colleagues have defined the the the the for as being a experience which is the& the to to do something thing, but without this to. to in a activity satisfactory. the& the
this which different the the the the for of the the the the apathy, he, it the the the is that the person not the the the is not in is of the the the be a task, that the the the it the depends.
with the the the the apathy, he, it not the the the there has not the the the the to of do something thing.
this which is the heart of the the the the for, he said, it the the the is the& the the the the the interruption the process of the the the attention, with to a me maussade and the feel that the time is slowly. the& the
the the the the for can very look to a depression.
but the professor eastwood has said that if the two can be linked, the people which if the the the ennuient have trend to think that the problem has of the the the the environment or the world, while that the people déprimées think that the problem has of the the the them.
sometimes, it we sometimes of think that we we dictatorships then that the the the it if the the the is in fact of the the the a problem of concentration.
in the framework of their study, the& the; unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention the& the, which has been published in the newspaper the& the prospects we psychological science the& the in september, the professor eastwood and its colleagues have set in obviously a experience more old in which the participants devastated on from, the votes of the the the a person in is of read a article of magazine.
some groups have course, in from of the room to on, the its too high of the the the a emission of tv which not the the the had no report, of the the the other have all just course the the the the emission of tv, and the third group not the the the has not the all course the bande-son.
those which have course the tv to a low level pose have said that the the the they if the the the were more annoyed that the two other groups- they have had the it to. concentrate, but not were not why, and have laureate this problem of concentration to the the the the for.
when you try of you concentrate on a task difficult or a, a interruption of the the the the attention can lead to the the the the for, has said mark j. fenske, a professor agrégé of neuroscience to the summer of guelph in the the the the ceta and the the the the a of authors of the the the the study.
in however, when you daul a task tedious, the& the as look of objects on a chain of line, the music can you help to not not you bore. the& the
in fact, he, to now, we know that when the the the we. tortille or that the the the we griffonne, these gestures, often considered as of signs of the the the for, are in fact a good way of remain mentally more warning.
the& the of studies have shown that the children which are allowed to gigoter learn more and stand more of the the the information that those which are forced to remain without you the& the, has said the professor fenske.
we we dictatorships all a day or the the the the another- the delay of my flight of the the the air, a locuteur with a votes sparkle, a film particularly boring.
but some people are more may of if the the the bore that of the the the other.
for it this, of researchers have developed a the& the scale of lifestyle to the the the the for the& the in the years 80.
the the the the scale includes of statements as, the& the among the tasks that i the the the just, many of the the the between they are repetitive and monotones the& the, and the& the i the the the i so of centres of the the the interest that i not the the the i not the time of all do. the& the
in using a such scale, the researchers have discovered that the boys have trend to if the the the bore more often that the girls, has said stephen vodanovich, a professor of psychologie to the summer of west reflects, and have particularly need of stimulations many and completely.
but in general, the young are quickly blasés.
in 1991, reed larson, a professor in development individual and community to the the the the summer of illinois, has they a experience the in of which it has contacted almost of 400 young and their parents seven to eight time by day via a beeper.
it has up that 32 for% of young déclaraient if the the the bore to the the the the school and for their duties to the house, while that 23 for% déclaraient if the the the bore when the the the they not the the the were not to the the the the school.
in however, 3 for% of parents have said if the the the bore.
the professor larson has said that the the the it not knew not if the percentage of the the the for of the the the today the the the today, be 21 years more later, would more high or governmental.
but it has added that the the the it knew that the& the the the the the adolescence is a period where the the the the for reached its more high level the& the, particularly because that the children and the young not the the the have not many of control on this that the the the they want do.
if i based my question: the the the the for is good for you?
sometimes not, because in its form extreme, this can lead the people to take of risks physical madness, do of paris or be of some substances for to the time, as the studies the this.
in however, of many apos and writers apos a link between the the the the for and the creativity, has said the professor vodanovich, which on the problem since more of two decades.
the& the the the the the for is the way that the brain has found for you do know that you should do another thing the& the, has said gary marcus, a professor of psychologie to the n.y.u.
but the brain not knows not always what is the thing the more appropriate to do.
if you you ennuyez and that you use this energy for play of the guitare and teaching, this you make happy.
but if you at the tv, this you make happy to short term, but not to long-term term.
then if your child if the the the weary and that you him an a ipad, it not if the the the ennuiera more, but it not the the the will not learned to if the the the after all only or to if the the the autorégler, says the professor fenske.
and the& the this autorèglement is of the the the a situation to a another the& the, compete.
your child not the the the finds not only to. as, it also more of we of himself in of the the the other areas.
i not think not that we should originator the the the the for.
all as i not think not not more that we should the-.
. feel to the the the the feel in outside the bouillonnement apos that while the activities and the technology is the the the the objective to which we should single.
the professor eastwood is of the the the agreement on this point.
the& the we have need of we bore more often, but the the the the for appetite a desire acute and frénétique of the the the be device to something thing which has the sense the& the, he said.
according him, this that the people are, it the the the is a way of. disconnect and of the the the appreciate the time of the the the it.
the& the in a environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés the& the, he added, the& the it is difficult of find of means of. to in something thing when the noise if the the the stop. the& the
in the colorado, no directive for the new law on the marijuana
anthony orozco, 19 years, student in a university and his of footballer in the colorado, is he for something thing which become soon legal in its state: the possession of boulettes of marijuana and of the the the a pipe used for the smoking.
mr orozco has said that the the the a day, in september, him and few friends. were to on of the the the a car to lamar, the middle of fields, almost of the border with the kansas, when they have been arrested.
after that the the the the officer of police has found the marijuana in the car, mr orozco has received a with to – for possession of drugs and material could serve to its consumption- of crimes minors, everyone if the the the would of the the the a fine of 100$- and a when of court.
the& the we are treaties as of criminals the& the, has said mr orozco.
but in is a?
for the weeks of the the the uncertainty which have followed the vote the colorado for legalising the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for its use staff, the answer organisation to of hundreds of the the the affairs involving a low use of drugs on more the place that of the law.
here and in the the the the state of washington, which has adopted a able similar, of hundreds of crimes involving the the the the use of marijuana have been two-tiered without following.
the services of police have continued of the the the charge of adults of 21 years and more for possession minor of marijuana, because the law come in force in the weeks to come.
but the prosecutors which. are in the constituencies more portrayed the colorado have called to up the affairs of marijuana existing and still of the the the charge the people which in have.
time, several cities of suburbs of denver until the the the to mountains of the the the the west vote currently for prevent the the the the openness of businesses of sale of marijuana reviews by the the the the state in their districts.
the& the the things are if quickly that i not know not this that we reserve the the the the future the& the, has said daniel j. oates, the head of the police of the the the aurora, to the the the the is of denver.
the bodies of regulation of the the the the state of washington. are also not it of questions.
they are in gaining of directives on the way of the the the up a system of allowed, permission to produce, invent, distribute and sell- before the when deadline the 1 december 2013.
they say that the colorado, that the the the we the whether or not, is in ahead on the most of states in on of regulation on the marijuana, all of the the the first on the the the the use to of purposes therapeutic and now in this which concerns the the the the use staff.
the& the the colorado has a market more regulated, and is a good indicator the& the, has said brian szilard smith, spokesman the washington state liquor disease renewed.
but no place or system, recognises mr smith, not can do more that suggest this which works.
the& the it not the the the there has not of real precedent on which we could we work, he said.
the law of washington, which if the the the called i-502, takes indeed the 6 december, this which leaves a empty legal of the the the a year, during which the system of allowed not the the the happen always not, then that the possession of marijuana will legal.
for this time, of questions practices are in outstanding: how evenly the mandate of the the the the state which guarantees a access appropriate to the marijuana agréée and from the the the the installation of businesses of sale of cannabis in a radius of 30 km around of the the the a school, of the the the a park, of the the the a ground of game or of the the the a manger.
the& the it not the the the there will not of places more difficult that the areas urban for up a trade is of sale of cannabis, particularly in the area heathrow of seattle the& the, has said ben livingston, a spokesman the centre of legalisation the cannabis, a group of research recently trained.
the 21 november, the head of the police, oates, to aurora, has sent a e-mail to its officers bang that the the& the am attorney the& the( representative the ministry public) not impact more the people of 21 years and more which have of small quantities of marijuana, and that the police to stop of the the the charge of people for this type of crime the& the to indeed immediate. the& the
the head oates has said that the police only the new decisions of justice which transitory the the the the activity of those which need the marijuana to of purposes medical, and that the the the it kaczyński of continue the traffickers of drugs and the helping.
to weld be, in the north the colorado, the the& the district attorney the& the( prosecutor of the republic), ken buck, embodied a vision more stricter.
after the vote, it has said that its office kaczyński of if the the the after of affairs of possession of marijuana, mainly order of do pressure on the users for that the the the they. only give.
to the the the the at current, 119 people are for of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of the the the between they are the the the the subject of the the the other inculpations.
the& the our office has the the the the obligation of the the the proceedings of take against these people which have committed a crime which, to the the the the time of facts, was a infringement convicted the& the, has said mr buck.
the responses have been complicated even in of places rural as mesa be, where the there have rejected the the the the initiative in favour of the consumption restricted of marijuana.
the police to great junction, the more great city the county, not fact more – of the the the adults for possession of quantities restricted.
the representative the ministry public the county, pete hautzinger, has supported this decision, but has also decided of not not classify without following all the affairs of detention of marijuana.
the& the i not the the the i not the the the the impression of lose my time to continue of the the the apply the law until the the the to this that the the the it exchange the& the, he said.
, that 55 cross-compliance of there the colorado have supported the able, offer a framework legal and government appropriate to the consumption personal of marijuana not the the the is not thing easy.
and the responses conflicting which have been observed in different cities american are in obviously the deep ambivalence among the official local in this which concerns the legalisation of the marijuana.
the& the it if the the the is of the the the a barrier cultural the& the with the representatives the ministry public, has said sean mcallister, a lawyer of denver which represents the people with of consumption of marijuana and which if the the the expressed in as that spokesman local of the the& the national 3.2 for; reform of marijuana laws the& the( organisation national for the reform of laws on the marijuana).
the& the they have past a good part of their life to continue in justice of people which consommaient of the marijuana, also, have the it to accept that this be legal the& the, he said.
in as that first states to with the consumption restricted of marijuana the even level that the of the the the the alcohol, the colorado and the the the the state of washington are in is of become a case of judicial for the legalisation of drugs.
then that the defenders and of representatives of the the the the state future a new border of at regulated, they expect with concern the directives the government federal, which is always the sale and the culture of marijuana as of crimes federal.
the defenders of the legalisation of the marijuana hope that the ministry of the justice cèdera.
despite some arrests médiatisées of patients under marijuana transplantation and of sellers, the government federal has especially allowed to businesses of sale of marijuana to of purposes therapeutic of the the the exert in the colorado, to washington and in 16 other states.
if the the the it is true that the police not will probably not down the doors for to of small cited of drugs, it there has very to will that the the the it if the the the against to businesses reviews of sale of marijuana to use staff allowed by the new laws, has said kevin sarsenbayev sabet, a former advisor policy of the the the the administration obama.
of many cities the colorado not the the the have not expected that the authorities know act.
, before the votes, some administrations local have approved of or on the creation of new businesses of sale of marijuana, even if the the the it not if the the the is that of the the the a postponement of the the the a year.
the week last, the city of montrose has did a moratorium of 6 months, and should impose this ban the week next.
the& the we not want not we find in a situation where a allowed is devoted to someone the the the a and then we find with to a problem federal the& the, has said bob nicholson, a member the council city.
our community has voted against this amendment.
we we keen the vote of the community rather that the the the the vote of the the the the state.

singapore research of babies for save the the the the economy
the singapouriens untouched the responsibility of this lack of the the the children on the career, the stress and the cost of the the the the access to the property.
the& the the population of singapore must. develop the& the.
i am a husband and a he, you es my wife and a he, fulfilling our duty civic and our the life!
it can may far-fetched that these words come of the the the a advertising for of tablets to the smell, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video if the the the is spread as a like of like on youtube to singapore the beginning of this year.
the words come of the the the a group of hendecasyllabic which use of references local as the& the will to a open in the drawer the& the for. utter the rate of birth of singapore.
bbh, the the the the agency of advertising to the the the the origin of the video, hope draw the the the the attention on the problem of way amusing thanks to this advertising.
its director creative, douglas hamilton, has said that the the the it wanted use the power of the music for that the people fulfilling the& the their duty national the& the.
it is intended only to the the the the internet, we have therefore could the to divertissante and amusing.
it if the the the is the problem main in this countries.
we are the worst the world in the area of the birth, and we felt that it the the the was a issue that we should issue.
we knew that the government had tried several things as to of odours to phéromones or organise of parties of speed-dating.
many of these ideas were creative but they not the the the have not necessarily worked.
we we are therefore said the thing following: what of more creative for solve this problem that of the the the in do a song of hendecasyllabic?
1.2 children
the government of singapore not the takes not as to the this.
it big 1,300 dollars usd by year in political for encourage its citizens to have more of the the the children.
a able the government in favour of marriages and of fathers over until the the the to 15,000 dollars by child, allonge the maternity of leave and collects of profits tax.
but all this has had little of the the the effects.
singapore is a cité-état rich and of high technology the south-east of the the the the asia, also known for the all of its leaders and its strict controls social.
the rate of birth of singapore, with to its distribution national of population,. is currently to 1.2 children by woman.
the last time that the the the it if the the the is found above of 2, treated as the rate of renewal, it the the the was in 1976.
why therefore the singapouriens not the the the have not more of the the the children?
tan wei ming, guideline of political the marriage and of the family of the division national of the population, states that it the the the is had to a the& the better education the& the and to the& the a choice more broad of the the the opportunities of career the& the.
the& the this has allowed to people of have of the the the a more broad range of the the the options in terms of the the the objectives of life and of priorities, beyond the marriage and of the constitution of the the the a family the& the, explique-t-elle.
these changes of standards social have contributed to the the the the increase the number of single and to delay the marriage and the socially, this which has for result a reduction the rate of birth to singapore.
meantime, a policy of the the the immigration for to increase clearly the the the the immigration for counter the reduction of the population has created a resentment the in of the population local.
to singapore, we is of sites to which agree a xenophobia to penalty disguised to the the the the against of new immigrants, in particular towards the chinese which are accused of from the wages to the low and of not not if the the the integrate.
the the the the increase of the the the the immigration is also seen as a of reasons for which the party in place to singapore has known the the the the year last its worst results election since the the the the independence.
since the elections, they have tried of to the problem with the implementation in place of quotas and of taxes more high for the workers foreign.
consequences inespérées
then that the fall the rate of birth has of effects known on the growth economic of the the the a countries, the income tax, the costs health and the political of the the the immigration, the the the the example of singapore has also of consequences unintended.
the government to of the the the avoid the construction of many small houses.
by example, this has started to affect the sector real.
the authorities the development urban have started to control the number of small flats, known under the name of the& the box to shoes the& the, could be built in of areas apos of the city.
these flats have a area of 46 metres square and their sale must many of success.
however, the authorities are about by the fact that the the the they can promote a lifestyle of life of célibataire and is the advocates way build of large houses family.
but lim yew chee, director general of the society property el developers, states that its the& the boxes to shoes the& the. boutiques many more quickly that the housing more large.
they are more popular, in the sense where these housing. floating, more quickly that those of more great size.
for this reason, it the the the is, more profitable for our cash-flow.
however, it valid that the new standards give of a more clear to advocates, to which we thoroughly before of way in the way if the the the they wanted propose too of small housing in a project.
too of stress
singapore is a cité-état.
if as is that these new apply can be a not to the the the the increase the rate of birth national, in noted with the singapouriens which work in the headquarters financial the centre, it seems that the the the they not the the the do not have many of the the the effects.
the& the the people are very suffer, the houses are expensive, all as the the the the education, it the the the is for this that the people the again to more later the& the, says a young framework.
the other people can have of children.
the& the but for me, it is important of power have of my money and of my time the& the, we says a another young of the the the a 20 of the the the years.
the men and the women analysts their career, the stress and the cost of the the the the access to the property and of the the the the education as the reasons the from of the the the have of children.
and,, that the government to of convince its citizens of the the the have of children, when it if the the the is of do of babies, this are the singapouriens themselves which have the last word.

questions key
marielos porras, professor of the the the english and discovers in education and learning, considers that, for targeted the children and the young, we must understand that the aim of networks social is of the the the informed.
the& the the the the the internet has compel as a way of seek of information but, with the the the the appeared of these sites, the rule the game has changed the& the, mentionne-t-elle.
porras out that the the the the académicien case prensky, which has a master in visual of the the the the university of yale and author the paper the& the natifs and immigrants digital the& the, use these terms for explain the phenomenon.
the natifs digital, this are them, the children and the young which are born with the technology.
the& the we, we are the immigrants digital which must that their teach, then that we are ourselves in is of the the the learn the& the, t.
it rajoute that the issue is complex, the& the because that we their for of the the the have a criterion defined on this that the the the it be or not of disclose, of publish or of say to a age where they not the the the have not the maturity necessary for the do the& the.
the& the we their for also of the the the be selective then that this which their any the more is of the the the be popular, of the the the have of thousands of the the the friends without think to consequences the& the says.
according the expert, the way the more effective of the the the teach the confidentiality to children and to young is of the the the use of questions which the are think.
the& the their say of not not the do not is to nothing the& the, dissolved.
then, porras lists few examples: it there has of things that you not raconterais not to a abroad, why the fais-tu on the the the the internet?
or, this you plairait-il that the the the they publish a photo of you as the of the the the a friend that you apos published?
” this that the other publish on you?
when you identifies of pictures of and, demandes-tu to other people the permission of the identify?
and also, all the world he need of know this that you am to every at?
a another point is of their do understand that the the the they must act in line as they the are outside line.
this are the same rules.
the& the outside of the the the the internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and of the the the other principles, this must be same on the networks social the& the, dissolved.
surveillance
estuardo guardia, professor of the the the university, teachers primary and advisor of the the the education, says that the the the it is essential that the parents read consciencieusement the conditions of the the the use of networks social.
in comprising everyone of terms, they will of for solid for discuss with their children of implications of the the the the openness of the the the a account on internet.
the& the by example, the the the the age and this that the the the it is allowed of share or of publish the& the, he.
according guardia, it is essential of remind to children that the the the it not must not about to foreign.

those which we outspokenly the night not. endanger never nothing, to the the the the opposite, we, the american, the the the the have all signed.

and it think that the& the if the britain accordait the sauf-conduit as tomorrow, this. terminerait the& the.
and if the sweden, as the can all to fact its legislation, and as it the the the the has already fact in of the the the other case, wondering mr assange in the the the the embassy of the the the ecuador to london, or the the the the wondering via skype tomorrow, the problem would also resolved.

the& the the more large enemies of the freedom of the press not are not the men political malicious or adverse but the bad journalists to the apos of the the the the greed, the blackmail and of the the the the extortionist the& the, he said.
under this from, it if the the the is congratulated that this not be not this kind of journalists the& the or the bankers or the countries hégémoniques and bourgeois which are in ecuador the& the and, rather that of to in before its re-election, the& the it approfondirait the revolution for continue the way and draw the good way the& the.

for the at, this judgment not the the the is not respected.
it the the the is a problem between a countries logistical and a countries central.
the conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the will of the the the forward together.
it must the solve in their together for the escape and go of the the the the before.
in the even time, it if the the the is said gesture in the good resolution the dispute on the borders maritime which against the peru and the chile the in the even court and it has said that the the the it is the& the good that the the the the america latin chance the management international if the two countries if the the the agree to accept a judgment if firm that the the the it be the& the.

the level staff, the power not i the the the has never interested, but in of situations also unjust that those of the the the the ecuador, this poverty socio-economic not can. solve that by the through the power policy.
the& the my movement policy has believed that it the the the was me which thus this will victory but we must accept this responsibility the& the, he said.

the head of the the the state fr has part today the the the today to lima the life summit of heads of the the the state and of government of the the the the union of nations american( american) which if the the the is ended by a appeal to a better integration regional order of support the progress, the the the the equality and the security.
the death linked the aids are today the the the today due to a detection late.
fabrizio had 21 years when the the the we him has confirmed the result the test: séropositif.
the& the it the the the is as if the sky i the the the was has on the head the& the, he in. by the at of the the the the announcement, that the doctor had tried of to the& the less practically the& the, in was.
the young human the the the the has hidden to its family.
it has decided of. matters only of its disease and has started to if the the the informed to its about and its determination has been such that the the the it has of have its 43e anniversary.
it is, without no doubt, a of more old patients of the the the the unity the hiv of the the the the hospital civil of guadalajara( hcg), in which it if the the the is found in 1994 after of many arguments.
fabrizio live with the virus of the the the the immunodeficiency human( hiv) since 22 years, something thing of difficult to imagine the beginning of years 90, where it there had many of doubts, little of choice of treatment and more of stigma.
then, even the director of the the the a hospital of the the the the imss évitait of him say the review the& the because that the the the it was without votes the& the.
in this time, have the aids was mean of death.
today the the the today, it is possible of survive to this syndrome and of the the the have a good quality of life.
however, above their disease, of many people arrive still when the virus has already caused of damage, the& the exhausted the& the their system immune and are victims of the the the infections egotists.
31 years after the the the the appeared the aids in the world, in all the case after the first case reported, the& the the great victory is today the the the today that the survival of the the the a patient with started a treatment the at appropriate and the survival of the population in general be exactly the even the& the, has as the head of the the the the unity the hiv the hcg, zabludovsky andrade villanueva and it takes for reference that this information has been upheld in april of this year in a publication scientific prestigieuse.
the the the the infectiologue and expert in hiv/ aids, andrade villanueva, has was that since 2008, the scientists have concluded that the aids not the the the was more a disease deadly, but that the number of the the the years of survival and the quality of life dépendait the level of the the the reap the system immune that with the patients the at the diagnosis, with of best prospects for those not consommant not of drugs: until the the the to 30 years for a rate of cd4 of 200 and until the the the to 50 years for those peak a rate of 500 cd4.
for about simply, this means that for someone the the the a which cooperative a diagnosis hiv positive to 25 years, the& the as that the the the it will under control, will live without problems until the the the to 75 years the& the, has explained the scientific questioned.
order of put this progress in its context, it must know that the the the the expectancy of life of mexicans is today the the the today of 76 years in average.
if the the the it is true that the mortality has by of way significantly these last years, in the case the mexico, the number of people by of us the aids is past of 6,678 case in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011( according the report annual of the the the unaids), but it is also true that, since the the the the appeared the aids, 60% of patients labour on the basis of data national are died.
nothing that the the the to jalisco, 255 people are died in 2011, and it there has had 187 deaths until the the the in may of this year the however, we we assure that the the the the access to medicines anti-retroviral is universal since 2005.
then why y-a-t-il still of death?
i think that the problem not has not of the the the the access the treatment.
it the the the is as this that i the see, it the the the is this which if the the the is past in our hospital.
on the 12 last years the less, we not the the the have never over of medicines, the problem is that the patients arrive to of stages very advanced because they not know not that the the the they are infected, or then they the the the the learn to of stages advanced of the disease.
it we gives a fact question the& the nine patients on ten arrive then that the the the they are already a infection tactical, this that the the the it must for have a more great impact on the mortality overall, it the the the is to of diagnostics more earlier and, for this, it must propose of tests of screening of way mass, to all the people which the demand the& the.
the specialists and the member the council of the the the state of prevention the aids of jalisco( coesida) if the the the agree on its proposal, of even that the patients themselves, as fabrizio, which has the do its test of screening in a laboratory private, simply because that the the the a friend the the the the had fact and that, despite its young age, it was already convey the aids and from the sarcome of kaposi, a tumour cancerous which is the the the the a of complications is.
all exchange when you news that you have the aids.
some think that the the the they will die and not want nothing know.
the& the if i will die, it applies better that i i the the the out three time by week the& the, they, this not the the the is not my case.
the change has been good, i byelorussia,, i am of the the the the president-in-office, i my my medicines.
to this day, its parents know only that the the the it from of the the the a cancer.
i the the the i a life normal, as not the the the any which of the the the another.
the& the i working, i the the the i many of the the the activities, i travel, i the the the i a life sexual active, but jointly, i am attention to me and to the the the the another person the& the, story fabrizio, which has accepted of share its privately with milenio jalisco for help, thanks to its testimony, those which have fear today the the the today, at of the that of the day world against the aids.
that the the the they only the test, if the the the they have taken of risks, more they will early if the the the they are hiv-infected and better this will, and if the the the they have already the diagnosis, it must that the the the they know that the the the the we can live as all the world, in being responsible.
its message- the slogan of the battle against the aids in this year 2012.
of condoms on the counter
it there has of many pastureland between the programmes of health and the citizen ordinary, support ricardo as, journalist of guadalajara which has espoused the because the hiv.
and the more great lies in the prevention.
in all the places innovatory to this, the& the we has indeed increased the distribution of condoms, before we we in- a or two, now we we in gives of packets of%, it the the the is very,, but it in result, that the the the today the the the today still, some not the the the have not access to condoms the& the, affirme-t-il.
among the more vulnerable to new infections, we at the young.
the question: the& the that the the the what that you quot in do? the& the, raised with cynical and judgments of value by the workers social, the councillors of the the the their, the pharmacists and the professionals of health, is the question that the young not the the the have not to of the the the hear, assure the journalist.
it proposes of restructured this distribution ineffective the that the condoms not are not only sold to akin, but that the the the we the is in the distributors of toilets public and in the places that go the young.
it not if the the the is not of the the the encourage the policing.
it not if the the the is not not more of their pay the girls and the motel, as had answered the governor emilio gonzález when the the the we him had asked if the the the it there have a distribution of condoms the in of its administration.
the& the this not the the the is not as this that works the dimension, the better is of provide of condoms to people already active sexually the& the, he out.
the figures to jalisco
we have 13,435 case cumulative( 12,158 the aids and 1,317 the hiv).
the the the the state is the citation state the countries in number of new case and case cumulative of aids and 13e for the number of ill the hiv.
92% of contamination. are by way sexual, 6% by way blood and 2% by way périnatale.
we estimated that 50,000 people live with the hiv, since for every case registered, it there has 4 or 5 people which the the the the not.
a judgment ratified in appeal by a court of united not the restructuring of the debt the group ivf willing via a bankruptcy trade the mexico. the scenario lead a precedent would for all the societies national with of links in the countries neighbours and with of problems of solvency.
we say therefore that the procedures of survival of societies accepted by the laws mexican not are not valid in the countries to the flag blinding, to contrepied of agreements international.
of the the the a point of view practice, the coup of the judgment visited the 15 june last by the judge harlin hale of the court of out for the district north the texas, leaves the societies mexican without defence face to the possibility of the the the embargo of their property beyond the bravo.
however, the resolution will afford the main manufacturer of glass the mexico of to the court supreme of united in. based on three inconsistencies.
of the the the first, then that the judge of the because out that the creditors must if the the the been according the law on the out of united, the court of the the the appeal the fifth stimulates, on to the should, states that the procedure main is the bankruptcy trade formalisée the mexico.
the first point would of denounce the cooperation of procedure international in the case of the the the insolvency of the the the companies with a profile transnational.
of fact, the law model of nations united for the the the the uniformity the right commercial international had been created to this end in taking the the the the american law institute as referee.
in second place, the judgment strikes that without the vote intersociétés, recognised in the mass criticism of the bankruptcy trade, the debts unequal by subsidiaries of ivf towards the society mother, the majority required for the the the the approval of the restructuring not the the the have not could be achieved.
however, the laws mexican acknowledge this possibility.
of fact, the case of ivf not the the the is not the first to use this plan.
it there has here a dozen of the the the examples, among which agremex and comercial mexicana, which the the the the institute federal of out trade had guarantees the debts.
in furthermore, this which is some is that, since the the the it never the votes of subsidiaries, of all the ways the creditors of ivf which. are ground against this in the courts of united, it the the the other the funds the& the vautour the& the as aurelios capital, aurelios convergencia, elliot internacional and city respectively, not the the the would not did the majority.
the vote have been of 45 votes against 37.
a data omitted by the court of the the the appeal.
of the the the a another on, ivf has been blâmé for the situation difficult that the the the it advocating since 2008 without if the the the stop to the serious crisis economic that the the the affrontait the united, répercutant the costs the countries.
for the the the the at, the society of the family gonzález sada interjettera appeal before the even court of the the the appeal for that the vote has place in its all, it the the the is to say with the five become, since only three had voted.
the use of the the the insurance réclamera the non-prospérité and requires the review the trial by a it higher, in this case the court supreme of justice of united.
the more serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the government the mexico the name of the the the the amicus amicus( the& the friend of the court the& the) in which was detailed the procedure followed by ivf in the framework of the law on the out trade, in out that this the libérait of conventions signed by the two countries for the to the even level that the the the the paragraph 15 of the law on the out of united.
of more, it out that the countries if the the the is plié to principles of the commission of nations united on the trade international, it the the the other the rules set for the case of the the the insolvency cross-border, which ensure the the the the fairness for the accumulation and the creditors.
carambolage of two parties: they assomment ivf and they assomment the countries.

héctor the& the hetin the& the reyes the& the the basketball is any my life the& the
the globe-trotteur the basketball the& the hetin the& the reyes has past more of 60 years of its life in relationship with the ground and, thanks to him, has endemic in the world over.
little of people to puerto rico have a knowledge of the the the the history the basketball local also great that the of the the the héctor the& the hetin the& the reyes.
the reason in is that the the the before that the the the a drain brain not the condemn the gavel rolling in 2008, reyes has been immergé in this sport for more of 60 years, that this be in as that his of football inferior, his of the the the the team national of basket, manager and leader of the the the the team national, the bsn, with the vaqueros of bayamón or in as that president of the federation of basketball.
the& the i the the the i of several hats in the basketball all the long-term of my life, and even several in even time, as when i the the the was president the bsn, director general of the the the the team national and president of the federation for the years 90 the& the,. remember reyes at of the the the a visit of primera hora home him to bayamón, where it lies with isabel, its do wife since more of 50 years.
the& the the basketball is any my life the& the.
reyes not the the the do not when it fact this statement.
the walls of its house, almost all décorés of pictures and of memories which vividly its agenda outside standards, in this.
bayamón in the heart
of all its memories, those that the the the it treasures the more are those which him vividly its an as his the in of the the the the team of vaqueros the middle of years 50 until the the the to 1982, after have past 15 years in as that co-manager or manager of the the the the team.
the& the this has been my best years, those which i the the the i the more taken because that i the the the i had the chance of part to eight championship of vaqueros to from of 1967, that this be as manager, co-manager or leader.
this fact many of the the the years of satisfaction, there including the five championship sites of 1971 to 1975.
i i am then withdrawn at the championship in 1981, the the the the year where jerome mincy is entered in the the the the team the bsn.
to from of that, the& the cuco the& the ortiz, which was a great administrator, has taken the head of the the the the team the& the, made reyes.
i i remember that gene bartow, which had been leader here and which. was to the the the the university of the the the alabama( birmingham), i the the the has said: the& the i the the the i a his costaud for you, it able two metres.
you the want? the& the
it the the the is as this that the the the to start mincy, a of better players that the the the has had puerto rico.
bartow i the the the has then recommended loulle gausse, which has been naturalisé and which was a of better mercenaries.
i i remember that the the the it said that if mincy had allowed to bayamon of winning a championship, gausse was we help to try of the the the in winning a another.
it if the the the is eplp the championship of vaqueros with gausse, but only to remote since the the the in 1988 it was already the great manitou of the federation.
in this time, it having benefit of its charges and of those of mincy in the the the the team national.
i i remember when we the the the the have won for the first time to united at the tournoi pré-olympique of mexico in 1989.
then, it there has had the world of 1990, where we are arrived citation and where we have had winning the medallists of bronze if this judge canadien not we had not fact rejouer the last game, has said reyes.
the the the the team the world of 1990 is the better team national that you have view?
it fact part of best, all as the which has his the dream team at of games olympic of 2004.
but my nabucco is the of games panaméricains of cuba in 1991, when we have won the the the the however and that we have set a raclée to the the the the team of united, which was enough similar to the which had won the bronze at the world.
this team not the the the was not only composed of mincy, gausse, ramon rivas, fico lópez and the& the piculín the& the( ortiz), it there had also the young( mr) the& the toñito the& the colón and james jimmy, the brotherhood león( virgin and fugitive) and mario the& the quijote the& the morales, which not the the the had not could attend the world of 90 to because of the the the a problem of knees.
a team which not the the the was perhaps not the better in terms of the the the individuals, but it we has given a medallists of the the the however and a great said at the tournoi pré-olympique of neuquén in argentina.
with of players as the& the canito the& the nieves, with alicea and the young rolando hourruitiner in replacement of players were by the the the the mess of games panaméricains of empress del plata, we have won the the the the however against all the favourable.
what has been the best his of puerto rico?
without no doubt, it if the the the is of piculín ortiz.
its statistics the level of tournois international are impressive.
person to puerto rico not the the the has dominated to this level as the the the the has fact piculín.
and this without take in account its knowledge in the different football for which it has played.
which has been the best leader portoricain?
it the the the is very difficult to say.
we have had a good team composed of who toro, flor meléndez, blown morales, loulle dalmau, armandito torres.
in the young, i the the the like many the work that fact szilard arill.
for you, what is your more great success the in of the federation?
have fact part of the the the the time the more ugly of the the the the team national between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that the the the the beginning of years 1990, the bsn ones until the the the to 17 teams in a season.
that you what to do?
it there has of things that i the the the would to to in place, as the regionalisation of categories minor.
by example that the boys of pontius play only in their area and foreseen only of teams of other to of the the the the island at of play-offs national.
today the the the today, the young travel and play too then that this not the the the is not necessarily necessary.
i the the the i the less seen the the the the advantage of qualifications mandatory and of in for the leaders, the staff of ground and the referees.
this i makes happy.
that you today the the the today?
in general, i the the the listen of the music, i at of clips of my time on youtube, i committee of my grandchildren and, of time in time, i the the the widespread to of matches of basketball.
and, course, i committee of the company of my wife, isabel, which has always been to my sides.
